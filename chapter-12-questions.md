# Chapter 12: Questions

After the almost-moment at The Point, things between Cameron and me felt different—more fragile, more weighted. We still met for coffee and studied together, but there was a careful quality to our interactions now. Like we were both aware of the line we'd almost crossed.

But I noticed other changes too.

Cameron seemed distracted at our meetings—checking his phone more often, his responses delayed. Dark circles appeared under his eyes. And when I'd see him with his crew team friends, his body language looked tense in ways it hadn't before.

"You okay?" I asked on Monday morning over terrible coffee.

"Yeah. Fine. Just tired. Practice has been brutal." He smiled, but it didn't reach his eyes. "Coach is pushing us hard for the winter training schedule."

"If you need to skip our study sessions to get more sleep—"

"No." He said it quickly, firmly. "I want to be there. I need—" He stopped, seemed to reconsider his words. "The library sessions help. Studying with you helps. I don't want to skip them."

But something was wrong. I could feel it.

That afternoon, I was walking back from chemistry lab when I saw them—Cameron and his crew team friends clustered outside the boathouse. Tyler was doing most of the talking, his posture aggressive, one hand jabbing toward Cameron to emphasize whatever point he was making. The other guys stood around watching, clearly uncomfortable.

Cameron's arms were crossed, his jaw tight. He said something I couldn't hear from this distance, and Tyler laughed—sharp and mocking.

I quickly changed direction, not wanting to be seen watching. But the image stayed with me—Cameron surrounded by his teammates, defending something while they clearly disagreed.

When Cameron met me at the library that evening, he was quieter than usual. We worked in silence for a while before I finally worked up the courage to ask.

"Is everything okay? With crew, I mean?"

"It's fine."

"Cameron."

He looked up from his textbook, and I saw genuine exhaustion in his expression. "Just team politics. Nothing to worry about."

"Didn't look like nothing this afternoon. Outside the boathouse."

His jaw tightened. "You saw that?"

"I was walking past. I wasn't spying or anything." I hesitated. "Do you want to talk about it?"

"Not really." Cameron rubbed his eyes. "It's just... differences of opinion about priorities. Tyler thinks I'm distracted. That I should be focusing more on training and less on..." He trailed off.

"Less on me."

"Less on things that aren't crew-related," he corrected, but we both knew what he'd meant.

I felt something cold settle in my chest. "He's not wrong. The regatta is important. Your college recruitment depends on it. You probably should be focusing on crew instead of helping me study."

"That's not—" Cameron started, then stopped. Took a breath. "My priorities are fine. Tyler doesn't get to decide how I spend my time."

"But he's right though. You have crew obligations. Team commitments. Things that actually matter for your future." I tried to keep my voice neutral. "I'm just someone you were assigned to mentor. You don't owe me all this time."

"Is that really what you think?" Cameron's eyes were intense. "That you're just an obligation I'm stuck with?"

"I don't know what I think anymore."

We sat in uncomfortable silence. Around us, other students studied quietly, oblivious to the tension at our table.

"Tyler doesn't understand," Cameron finally said. "None of them do. They think friendship has to fit into neat categories. That I can only be close with people from the right families, the right backgrounds. That spending time with someone like you is..." He stopped, clearly not wanting to say it out loud.

"Someone like me. A scholarship student. The charity case."

"I didn't say that."

"But that's what they think." I felt the sting of it, even though I'd known all along. "What Tyler said outside the boathouse. That I'm not worth your time. That you're wasting effort that should go toward crew."

Cameron's silence was answer enough.

"I'm sorry," I said quietly. "That your friends are giving you a hard time because of me."

"They're not—" He cut himself off, clearly realizing there was no point in denying it. "They don't understand. They think I'm choosing you over the team, which isn't true. But they can't wrap their heads around the idea that I can care about crew and also care about you. That both things can matter."

"Maybe you should listen to them. Focus on crew. Stop spending so much time—"

"No." Cameron's voice was sharp. "I'm not doing that. I'm not going to stop being your friend just because Tyler has opinions about who I should associate with."

"It's not just Tyler though, is it?" I thought about James's warning, about the looks from other students, about the unspoken rules everyone seemed to understand except us. "Everyone thinks it's weird. That we don't make sense together."

"Who cares what everyone thinks?"

"You should. Your crew team, your college recruitment, your whole future—all of that depends on fitting in with people like Tyler. Keeping your legacy student friends happy. Playing the role everyone expects." I closed my textbook. "I don't want to be the reason you mess that up."

"You're not—"

"Cameron." I met his eyes. "Be honest. Is your friendship with me causing problems with the team?"

He was quiet for a long moment. Then, reluctantly: "Tyler's been... vocal. About how much time I spend with you. Some of the other guys agree with him. They think I'm not committed enough to crew."

"Because of me."

"Because of their own narrow-minded ideas about who's worth knowing." Cameron's voice was tight with frustration. "But yes. They're making it an issue."

The guilt hit me hard. Cameron had been nothing but kind to me since I arrived at Lakewood. He'd helped me navigate a world I didn't understand, had listened without judgment, had become my closest friend here. And I was repaying that by causing problems with his team.

"Maybe we should—"

"Don't." Cameron cut me off. "Whatever you're about to suggest, don't. I'm not going to stop being your friend. I'm not going to avoid you to make Tyler happy. I'm not going to pretend you matter less than you do just because some people can't understand why we click."

The words "matter less than you do" hung in the air between us, weighted with meaning neither of us was ready to examine.

"But if it's affecting your crew performance—"

"It's not. I'm training just as hard. My times are still good. Tyler's just looking for something to criticize because he doesn't like that my life doesn't revolve entirely around the team anymore." Cameron's frustration was evident. "He's used to me being available for everything—every guys' night, every team dinner, every social thing. And yeah, I've been saying no more often because I'd rather spend time with you. That bothers him."

"Because I'm not part of your world."

"Because he's narrow-minded and can't see past social categories." Cameron softened his tone. "Look, I know this is complicated. I know people judge. But you're my friend, Sophie. One of my best friends. I'm not going to apologize for that or hide it or pretend it's less important than it is."

My chest felt tight. "I just don't want to make your life harder."

"You don't. You make it better." He reached across the table like he might take my hand, then seemed to think better of it and pulled back. "Tyler will get over it eventually. And if he doesn't, that's his problem, not yours."

I wanted to believe him. But I couldn't shake the image of Cameron outside the boathouse, surrounded by teammates who clearly thought he was making a mistake.

Later that week, Rachel came back from the student center with news.

"I heard Tyler talking today," she said, settling onto her bed. "About Cameron."

My stomach dropped. "What did he say?"

"He was asking Cameron why he's 'wasting time with the charity case' when Vanessa would take him back in a heartbeat." Rachel's expression was sympathetic. "Said Cameron's priorities are all messed up. That he should be focused on crew and keeping his real friends happy, not playing savior to scholarship students who don't appreciate it anyway."

Each word stung. "He said that?"

"Not to me directly. I overheard him talking to some crew guys." Rachel moved to sit next to me. "I'm sorry, Sophie. I know you care about Cameron. But this is what I've been trying to tell you. His world and our world don't mix. People like Tyler will never accept you as Cameron's actual friend. You'll always be the charity project to them."

"Cameron doesn't see me that way."

"Maybe not. But everyone around him does. And eventually, that pressure gets to people." Rachel's voice was gentle. "He's going to have to choose—his legacy student world or friendship with you. And when he does, you need to be prepared for what that choice might be."

"He already chose. He told Tyler no."

"For now. But Sophie, think about it. Cameron's whole future depends on maintaining relationships with people like Tyler. His crew recruitment, his Princeton connections, his entire social circle. Are you really sure he's going to keep choosing you over all of that?"

I wasn't sure. And that terrified me.

That evening, I sat in the library studying but mostly watching the crew team practice on the lake through the window. Cameron was easy to spot—taller than most of the others, his form perfect as they ran drills. Tyler stood on the dock shouting instructions, and Cameron responded instantly, completely focused.

This was his world. The boathouse with his family name on it. The team that would help him get recruited by college programs. The social circle that understood his background and expectations.

And I was asking him to risk all of that—his team cohesion, his friendships, his carefully maintained legacy student image—just to keep being my friend.

It wasn't fair.

The weight of the divide between our worlds had never felt heavier. Cameron might believe we could transcend it, but watching him surrounded by teammates who would never understand why he bothered with someone like me, I wasn't so sure.

Maybe Rachel was right.

Maybe eventually he'd realize that I wasn't worth the complications I brought to his life.

And maybe the kindest thing I could do was make that choice easier for him by stepping back before he had to.

But even as I thought it, I knew I couldn't.

Because whatever this was between us—friendship or something more, simple or impossibly complicated—I wasn't ready to let it go.

Not yet.

Not until I absolutely had to.
