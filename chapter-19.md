# Chapter 19: Realization

Late November arrived with the kind of crisp cold that made the lake look like hammered silver in the afternoon sun. Campus energy shifted as regatta preparation intensified—the crew team's biggest competition of the fall, Lakewood's chance to defend their home course title against three rival schools. Everywhere I went, I heard people talking about it. The dining hall buzzed with speculation about whether the team could maintain their winning streak, now five years running. Banners appeared on buildings, blue and gold proclamations of school pride. The athletic department sent out emails about attendance expectations, making it clear that supporting the crew team was practically mandatory. Even my professors mentioned it in passing, the subtle pressure to show up, to be part of the Lakewood community on race day.

And despite myself, despite everything, I found myself watching Cameron from a distance.

Not intentionally, at first. But Lakewood wasn't big enough to avoid someone completely, and once I'd seen him—really seen him—I couldn't stop noticing. He moved through his days like someone going through the motions. At crew practice by the lake, visible from certain campus paths, he was technically present but seemed elsewhere. In the dining hall, sitting with his teammates, he pushed food around his plate more than he ate it. Between classes, surrounded by friends, he wore a smile that didn't quite reach his eyes.

He looked hollow. Like someone had scooped out everything vital and left just the shell behind.

I told myself it wasn't my problem. That he'd made his choice and now had to live with it, just like I had to live with mine. But knowing that didn't stop me from noticing.

On Tuesday evening, I took a different route back to Whitman Hall after library hours, cutting behind Carmichael Dining Hall instead of going around front. I didn't plan to look in the windows. Didn't mean to stop and watch. But the crew team was having some kind of dinner celebration in a private room visible through the tall windows, and there was Cameron, surrounded by his teammates.

Tyler stood at the head of the table, raising a glass of what was probably sparkling cider. I couldn't hear the words through the glass, but I could see the team laughing, clapping, the camaraderie of athletes before a big competition. This was Cameron's world—the one he'd chosen over me. These were his people.

I watched Cameron's face as Tyler spoke. Saw him lift his own glass in the toast, saw him smile and nod. But something in his expression made my chest ache. He looked like he was performing. Like he was playing the role of Cameron Reid, Crew Captain, Legacy Student, Good Teammate, but the person inside was absent.

And then, just for a second, something shifted. Tyler said something—another toast, another rallying cry probably—and Cameron's face changed. Not to happiness or excitement, but to something that looked almost like resignation. Or clarity. Like he was seeing something clearly for the first time and didn't much like what he saw.

I made myself walk away before anyone noticed me watching. Before Cameron could look toward the window and see me standing in the dark like some kind of stalker. My breath formed clouds in the cold air as I hurried toward my dorm, pulling my jacket tighter against more than just the temperature.

"Did you hear about Cameron Reid?" Rachel asked the next day at lunch. We were sitting at our usual table with James and a few other scholarship students, the dining hall loud with midday conversation.

My fork froze halfway to my mouth. "What about him?"

"Apparently he left the crew team dinner early last night." Rachel took a bite of her sandwich, casual, like she hadn't just made my heart rate spike. "Just got up in the middle of Tyler's speech about legacy and tradition and walked out. Didn't say where he was going."

"That's weird," James commented. "Right before the regatta? Coach Anderson must have been pissed."

"Probably just stressed," another scholarship student offered. "I heard the pressure on legacy athletes is intense. Like, if they lose, they're not just disappointing the team, they're disappointing their whole family history."

The conversation moved on to other topics, but I couldn't focus. Cameron had left? Walked out of his own team dinner? That didn't sound like him at all. The Cameron I knew was responsible to a fault, would never do anything to jeopardize team morale before a major competition.

Unless something had changed.

That evening, I found myself walking toward The Point. I told myself I was just getting some air, clearing my head before another night of studying. But my feet carried me along that familiar path through the woods like they knew exactly where they were going, even if I was pretending not to.

I stopped before I reached the clearing, hidden among the bare trees. And there he was, sitting on our bench, alone, staring out at the lake as the sun began its descent toward the horizon. Even from a distance, I could see the tension in his shoulders, the way he held himself like someone carrying a weight too heavy to bear.

Every instinct I had screamed at me to go to him. To cross those last fifty feet, sit beside him on that bench, ask him what was wrong. We'd sat there so many times before, talking through problems, finding comfort in each other's presence. It would be so easy to slip back into that.

But I couldn't. Wouldn't. Because nothing had actually changed. He was still the legacy student with family expectations and social standing to maintain. I was still the scholarship girl his friends thought was using him. Going to him now would just restart the same impossible cycle—secret meetings, stolen moments, the constant ache of being kept hidden.

I stood there in the woods for longer than I should have, watching Cameron watch the lake. He didn't move. Didn't check his phone or get up to leave. Just sat there as the light faded, alone with whatever thoughts were making his shoulders bow under their weight.

Finally, I made myself turn away. Made myself walk back toward campus, leaving him to his solitude. If he wanted me, he knew what I needed. Knew what it would take. And until he was ready to give me that—to choose me publicly, to acknowledge our relationship despite the cost—all the watching and wondering and wanting in the world wouldn't change anything.

On Thursday, I had my regular check-in with Dr. Hartley. She'd been keeping closer tabs on me since our last conversation, and I appreciated it even if it made me feel a little like I was being monitored.

"How are you doing?" she asked as I settled into the chair across from her desk.

"Fine," I said automatically, then corrected myself. "Okay. I'm okay."

She smiled slightly. "That's more honest."

We talked about my classes for a while, my progress on various assignments. Then, seemingly casual, Dr. Hartley said, "I saw Cameron Reid at the library yesterday. Third floor, near the history section."

My heart jumped. That was near my new study spot. "Oh?"

"He seemed to be looking for something. Or someone." Her eyes were kind. "He looked... well, not great, if I'm being honest."

I didn't know what to say to that.

"I'm not telling you this to influence you," Dr. Hartley continued gently. "Just offering information you might want to have. What you do with it is entirely your choice."

That night, lying in bed while Rachel's even breathing filled the dark room, I thought about Cameron searching the library for me. Walking past my old study spot and not finding me there. Looking for someone he'd lost because he'd been too afraid to hold on.

I wondered if he regretted his hesitation at The Point. If he'd replayed that conversation as many times as I had, examining every word, every pause, every moment he could have chosen differently. If he understood now that silence, in that moment, had been its own kind of answer.

The regatta was two days away. I should go, probably. Support the school, show school spirit, be a good Lakewood student. It was the biggest athletic event of the fall semester—everyone would be there.

But the thought of watching Cameron race, of being part of the crowd cheering for him while we weren't anything to each other anymore, felt impossible. Would he even want me there? Would seeing me in the crowd distract him, make things harder?

And selfish as it was, I wasn't sure I could handle watching him in his element—talented and admired and surrounded by his world—and not be part of it. Not matter to him in any public way.

Friday morning, I saw him again. Across the quad, heading toward class. He looked tired, shadows under his eyes like he wasn't sleeping well. Our eyes met for just a second before we both looked away, continuing in our separate directions.

But in that second, I saw something I hadn't seen before. Not just sadness or regret, but something harder. More resolved. Like he'd made some kind of decision.

I told myself not to read into it. Not to hope. Hope was dangerous when nothing had actually changed, when all the same obstacles still stood between us, when choosing me still meant choosing against everything else in his carefully constructed life.

But as I walked to class, I couldn't quite shake the feeling that something was shifting. That Cameron's hollow performance of his expected role was starting to crack. That maybe, just maybe, he was realizing the same thing I'd already learned: that being perfect for everyone else wasn't worth losing yourself.

Or losing the person who made you want to be real instead of perfect.

The regatta was two days away. Two days until Cameron would race in front of the entire school, defending Lakewood's legacy on his family's donated boathouse course, carrying the weight of four generations of Reid expectations.

Two days for both of us to decide what we were really willing to risk for a chance at something real.
