# Chapter 3: First Meeting

I arrived at Reid Library at eight forty-five, fifteen minutes early. The morning was cool and crisp, the kind of September weather that smelled like autumn was coming. I'd changed my outfit three times before settling on khakis and a plain blue sweater that was neither too casual nor trying too hard.

The library lobby was quiet this early, just a few students studying at tables near the windows. I sat on a bench near the entrance, pulled out a notebook, and tried to look like I was reviewing class notes instead of rehearsing what I'd say.

*Hi, I'm Sophie. Thanks for taking the time to do this.*

Too formal.

*Hey, thanks for meeting me.*

Too casual.

*I appreciate you volunteering to be my mentor.*

That sounded like I was acknowledging his charity.

I flipped the notebook closed and stared at the floor, willing my heart to slow down. This was ridiculous. It was just a campus tour with a stranger who was fulfilling a program requirement. There was no reason to be nervous.

Except that Cameron Reid represented everything I didn't understand about Lakewood—the ease, the confidence, the belonging. And I was about to spend an hour being his assigned responsibility.

At exactly nine o'clock, the library door opened.

I looked up and immediately recognized him from the student directory photo, though the picture hadn't quite captured the reality. Cameron Reid was tall—probably over six feet—with an athletic build that suggested serious training, not just casual gym visits. Dark hair, slightly wavy, worn just long enough to be fashionable. He wore khakis and a navy blue pullover with a white oxford underneath, loafers that probably cost more than my entire shoe collection. Everything about him looked expensive but not showy, like he'd been born knowing how to dress this way.

He scanned the lobby, and when his eyes landed on me, he smiled. A real smile, not the polite performance I'd been expecting.

"Sophie?" He crossed the lobby in a few long strides, holding out his hand. "I'm Cameron Reid. It's great to meet you."

I stood quickly, shaking his hand. His grip was firm but not aggressive, his palm warm. "Hi. Thanks for doing this."

"Of course." He gestured toward the main library space beyond the lobby. "Have you been in here yet?"

"Yesterday. Just to study."

"Good. Let me give you the actual tour—all the stuff they don't tell you in orientation." He started walking, and I fell into step beside him.

The library was bigger than I'd realized yesterday. Cameron led me through the main floor, pointing out sections as we walked.

"This floor is communal study—tables, group work, normal conversation is fine. Most people come here between classes or when they need to work on group projects." He nodded toward a cluster of students at a large table covered in papers. "It gets pretty busy in the afternoon."

We passed the circulation desk where a student worker was checking out books, then headed toward a staircase at the back.

"Second floor is quieter—individual study carrels, reading rooms, comfortable chairs. If you need to focus but don't need absolute silence, that's your best bet." Cameron took the stairs easily, clearly someone who spent a lot of time in this building. "Third floor is designated silent study. They enforce it, too. If your phone rings up there, you'll get kicked out for the day."

"Good to know." I followed him up to the second floor.

The space opened into a warren of study carrels tucked between bookshelves—small wooden desks with partition walls, each with a lamp and enough surface area for spreading out books and papers. Through tall windows, I could see the lake sparkling in the morning sun.

"These are first-come, first-served most of the time." Cameron ran his hand along one of the empty carrels. "But during exams, you can reserve them for four-hour blocks. There's a sign-up sheet at the circulation desk—starts two weeks before finals. People camp out overnight to get the good spots."

"Seriously?"

He grinned. "Lakewood takes academics very seriously. You'll see."

A girl walked past carrying a stack of books, and her face lit up when she saw Cameron. "Hey! When's the first regatta?"

"Three weeks. You coming?"

"Obviously. Tyler said it's going to be a slaughter."

"Tyler's optimistic." Cameron's smile was easy, familiar. "We'll see."

The girl continued past, and Cameron turned back to me like the interruption was completely normal. "Sorry. Where were we?"

"Study carrels."

"Right." He showed me the reading rooms—small spaces with comfortable chairs and better lighting, perfect for long reading assignments. Explained how to request books from the archives, where to find academic journals, how to print from the library computers.

Another student called out a greeting as we passed—"Reid, you coming to Brennan's thing tomorrow?"—and Cameron waved acknowledgment. Then a teacher stopped him to ask about crew practice schedules, and Cameron introduced me politely: "This is Sophie Bennett, she's new this year. I'm showing her around."

The teacher smiled at me. "Welcome to Lakewood, Sophie. Cameron's a good choice for a mentor—he knows this place inside and out."

When we finally made it to the third floor, I was starting to understand what Rachel had meant. Cameron seemed to know everyone. Every twenty feet, someone greeted him, asked him questions, made inside jokes I didn't understand. He moved through the space with the unconscious confidence of someone who'd never questioned whether he belonged.

The third floor was hushed, almost reverent. Students sat hunched over desks, the only sounds the whisper of turning pages and the scratch of pens. Windows overlooked the entire campus—the quad, the academic buildings, the lake in the distance.

"This is where I studied for my SATs," Cameron said quietly, respecting the silence. "That carrel in the corner. Four hours a day for two months."

"Did it work?"

"Got into the ninety-ninth percentile, so yeah." He said it matter-of-factly, not bragging. "But I also wanted to throw myself in the lake by the end of it."

Despite myself, I smiled.

We headed back downstairs, and Cameron led me to a small coffee station near the lobby—just a counter with a pot of coffee and some paper cups.

"Coffee's terrible but free." He poured himself a cup anyway. "Want some?"

"Sure."

He was right—it tasted like it had been sitting for hours. But I wrapped my hands around the warm cup and followed Cameron to a table by the windows.

"So," he said, settling into a chair across from me. "Tell me about your schedule. What classes are you taking?"

I ran through my list—English, history, chemistry, algebra, French.

Cameron nodded. "Good mix. Who do you have for English?"

"Mrs. Patterson."

"She's great. Tough grader but fair. She'll make you rewrite essays if they're not up to standard, but you'll actually learn." He took a sip of the terrible coffee. "Chemistry with Brennan or Rodriguez?"

"Rodriguez."

"Nice. He's strict about lab protocol, but his lectures are actually interesting." Cameron seemed genuinely engaged, asking follow-up questions about my other teachers, offering advice about which assignments to prioritize and which teachers gave extensions.

It wasn't what I'd expected. I'd braced myself for polite condescension, for him to go through the motions while mentally checking boxes. But Cameron was actually listening to my answers, making eye contact, treating this like a real conversation instead of an obligation.

"What about extracurriculars?" he asked. "Have you thought about joining anything?"

"Not really. I figured I should focus on classes first."

"Smart. But Lakewood has a lot of good options once you're settled. Newspaper, debate team, theater, sports." He leaned back in his chair, relaxed. "I'm obviously biased toward crew, but that's a pretty serious time commitment."

"How serious?"

"Practice six days a week, two hours a day. Plus regattas on weekends during season." He smiled. "Like I said, serious."

"That sounds intense."

"It is. But I like it." Something shifted in his expression, became more genuine. "It's one of the few things here that's actually mine, you know? Not because of family legacy or expectations. Just because I'm good at it."

I didn't know what to say to that. It was the first thing he'd said that sounded personal rather than informational.

Before I could respond, he checked his watch—expensive, leather band, the kind of watch that probably cost more than my mother's car payment.

"I should let you go. I'm sure you have homework." He stood, and I followed. "How about we meet tomorrow morning? I can show you around the academic buildings, help you figure out the fastest routes between classes."

"That would be helpful. Same time?"

"Works for me. Meet outside Whitman Hall? We can start from there."

"Okay. Thanks for this."

"No problem." Cameron smiled again, that same genuine warmth that kept surprising me. "See you tomorrow, Sophie."

He headed out, and I watched through the window as he crossed the lawn toward another building. Three different students called out to him before he made it twenty feet, and he responded to each one with easy familiarity.

I sat back down at the table, my coffee growing cold.

Cameron Reid was not what I'd expected. He wasn't condescending or performative. He'd been helpful, patient, actually interested in what I had to say. He'd treated me like a person, not a project.

Which made everything more confusing.

Rachel's warning echoed in my head: *You're a responsibility to him, not a person.*

But that wasn't how it had felt. For an hour, Cameron had given me his full attention, shared actual advice, even revealed something real about himself when he talked about crew.

Maybe he was just really good at making people feel comfortable. Maybe that was part of why he was popular—he knew how to make everyone feel like they mattered, even when they didn't.

Or maybe I was overthinking this. He was fulfilling his mentoring obligations, and he was doing it well because that's what Cameron Reid did—everything well, everything perfectly, everything exactly the way it was supposed to be done.

I gathered my things and headed back to Whitman Hall, trying not to think about how warm his smile had been or how it had made me feel, just for a moment, like maybe I could actually belong here after all.

It was dangerous, that feeling. I knew better than to trust it.

But I couldn't quite make it go away.
