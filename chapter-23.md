# Chapter 23: Sophie's Decision

I woke on regatta morning to the sound of excited voices in the hallway and footsteps thundering past our door. The entire dorm seemed to be buzzing with energy, girls getting ready for Lakewood's biggest athletic event of the fall semester.

"You awake?" Rachel asked from her bed across the room.

"Yeah." I stared at the ceiling, watching weak November sunlight filter through our window. Outside, I could hear more voices, more footsteps, the building excitement of a campus preparing for competition.

Rachel got up and started pulling clothes from her closet. "I'm thinking layers. It's going to be cold by the water."

I didn't move.

"Sophie." Rachel stopped what she was doing and turned to look at me. "You're coming, right?"

"I don't know." I sat up, pulling my knees to my chest. "I've been thinking about it all night."

"What's there to think about? Your boyfriend is racing in the biggest competition of the season. Of course you're going."

"My showing up will just create more gossip," I said. "More distraction. The team is already struggling because of us. Maybe the best thing I can do is stay away."

Rachel crossed the small space between our beds and sat on the edge of mine, fixing me with a look. "Is that really what you think? Or are you just scared?"

"I'm not—" I stopped. Because she was right. I was terrified.

"Be honest with me," Rachel said gently. "Are you staying away to protect Cameron and the team? Or are you staying away to protect yourself from more judgment and stares?"

The question hit like a punch to the gut. I opened my mouth to protest, to say it was about Cameron, about not wanting to make things harder for him. But the words died in my throat.

Because the truth was, I was scared. Scared of being the center of attention. Scared of hearing more whispers about social climbing and using Cameron. Scared of watching him race while hundreds of people who thought I didn't belong stared at me and judged every breath I took.

Staying in my room was easier. Safer. Less exposure to all the ways people could hurt me.

"Both," I admitted quietly. "I'm scared of making things worse for Cameron. But I'm also just... scared."

Rachel nodded like she'd expected that answer. "Okay. Let me ask you something else. Do you believe your relationship with Cameron is worth the social cost you're both paying?"

"Yes," I said without hesitation.

"Then you need to show up."

I looked at her, confused.

"Sophie, Cameron chose you publicly," Rachel explained. "He walked into that dining hall holding your hand, sat with you in front of everyone, told his best friend he'd rather lose the race than lose you. He put himself out there, made himself vulnerable, risked everything that mattered to him in his world."

"I know—"

"So now you need to do the same," Rachel interrupted. "You need to show up for him. Publicly. Despite the stares and the whispers and the fear. Because that's what being in a relationship means. Supporting each other even when it's scary."

"What if showing up makes things worse? What if my being there distracts him and they lose?"

Rachel gave me a look. "And what if you not showing up makes him think you're ashamed to be seen with him? What if he races and looks for you in the crowd and you're not there?"

I hadn't thought about that. About Cameron scanning the spectators, looking for my face, and finding nothing. About how that would feel for him—to have put everything on the line and not have me there to support him.

"He told Tyler he didn't care if they lost," I said weakly.

"And he meant it." Rachel's voice was firm. "But Sophie, you can't make him face the consequences of your relationship alone while you hide in our dorm room. That's not fair to him or to what you're building together."

"Everyone will stare."

"Let them stare."

"They'll whisper about me."

"Let them whisper."

"They'll judge everything—what I wear, where I stand, how I react—"

"And none of that matters as much as showing Cameron that you're all in too," Rachel said. "That you meant it when you said you wanted to be together publicly. That you're brave enough to support him even when it's uncomfortable."

I pulled my comforter tighter around myself, feeling the weight of the decision. "It would be easier to just stay here."

"Easier, yes. But would it be right?" Rachel stood up and went back to her closet. "Look, I'm not going to force you. It's your choice. But I think you already know what you should do. You're just scared to do it."

She was right. I did know.

Cameron had been brave for me. Had risked his reputation, his friendships, his team's cohesion. Had stood up to Tyler and chose me over the easy path. Had made our relationship public despite knowing exactly what kind of judgment we'd both face.

And what had I done? Gone to one dinner. Let him hold my hand while we walked across campus. But now, when it really mattered, when Cameron would be racing in front of the entire school while everyone watched to see if our relationship had cost them the race—I was considering hiding.

That wasn't fair. That wasn't being a partner. That was making Cameron be brave alone while I protected myself from discomfort.

I thought about what Dr. Hartley had said about the most important relationships being the ones that challenge us to be brave. About how courage wasn't just reaching out but also maintaining boundaries and asking for what we need. About choosing authenticity even when it was scary.

Cameron had asked me to be there. Had told me the plan was for me to come watch, to be present when he went fully public with our relationship after the race. And I was considering backing out because I was afraid of judgment.

What kind of message did that send? That I was only brave when things were private and safe? That I'd demanded Cameron go public but wouldn't show up to support him when it mattered most?

"You're right," I said finally.

Rachel turned around, clothes in hand, a smile spreading across her face. "Of course I am. Now get up and figure out what you're wearing. We need to leave in forty-five minutes if we want good spots by the water."

I climbed out of bed, my heart already racing with nervous energy. "I'm going to regret this, aren't I?"

"Probably," Rachel said cheerfully. "But you'd regret not going more. Trust me."

I stood in front of my small closet, staring at the limited options. Everything I owned suddenly seemed wrong. Too casual, too dressy, too obviously new, too obviously worn. What did you wear when you were about to be scrutinized by an entire school?

"The blue sweater," Rachel said, reading my paralysis. "With jeans and your boots. Warm, practical, and it looks good on you."

I pulled out the suggested outfit, grateful for the decision being made for me. My hands shook slightly as I got dressed, brushed my hair, tried to make myself look put-together even though my insides were churning with anxiety.

"This is terrifying," I said as I laced up my boots.

"Yep." Rachel pulled on her jacket. "But you're doing it anyway. That's what makes it brave."

We left Whitman Hall together, joining the stream of students heading toward the lake. The morning was cold and clear, perfect weather for a regatta. I could see my breath in the air as we walked, could hear the buzz of excitement building as we got closer to the water.

Part of me still wanted to turn back. To claim I felt sick, to hide in the library, to avoid the exposure and vulnerability of showing up. But I kept walking, kept putting one foot in front of the other, kept moving toward the place where Cameron would race and everyone would watch and I would have to be brave.

"You okay?" Rachel asked as we crossed the quad.

"No," I admitted. "But I'm going anyway."

"That's my girl." She looped her arm through mine. "For what it's worth, I'm proud of you. This takes guts."

We walked together toward the lakeshore, toward the watching crowd and the whispers and the judgment I knew waited for me. My heart hammered and my palms sweated despite the cold. But I kept going.

Because Cameron had been brave for me. Had chosen me publicly and dealt with all the consequences. The least I could do was show up. Be there. Support him even when it was scary.

So I would go to the regatta. I would stand in that crowd while everyone stared. I would watch Cameron race and hope the team won but be there regardless of the outcome. I would be visible and present and brave, because that's what this relationship required.

And afterward, when Cameron went fully public about us, I would be there for that too. Standing beside him. Facing the judgment together.

The path to the lake stretched ahead of me, and with every step, I chose courage over comfort. Chose Cameron over self-preservation. Chose to show up even when showing up was the hardest thing I could do.

That's what love required sometimes. Not just the easy moments when everything was private and safe, but the hard moments when you had to be brave in front of everyone watching.

So I would be brave. For Cameron, yes. But also for myself. For the relationship we were building. For the chance at something real and honest and worth fighting for.

I took a deep breath and kept walking toward the lake, toward the crowd, toward whatever came next.

Ready or not, I was showing up.
