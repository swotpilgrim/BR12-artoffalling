# Chapter 26: Racing

Five hundred meters to go.

The boats looked like they were barely moving, each stroke a desperate, grinding effort that gained mere inches. But I knew from the announcer's excited commentary that they were still moving fast—faster than I could run, faster than seemed possible for exhausted rowers pulling with everything they had left.

"Four hundred meters!" the announcer shouted. "Lakewood and Hadley still even! Neither crew giving up! Neither crew showing any weakness!"

The crowd's roar had become a constant wall of sound. I couldn't distinguish individual voices anymore, couldn't hear Rachel beside me, could barely hear the announcer over the collective screaming of hundreds of people willing their team to victory.

My eyes stayed locked on Cameron's back. On the relentless rhythm of his pull, never varying, never breaking, mechanical in its precision despite what had to be unbearable fatigue. On shoulders that had to be burning with exhaustion, muscles screaming in protest. On arms that had to feel like lead, each stroke requiring more willpower than the last. On a body pushed past any reasonable limit, operating on nothing but pure determination and refusal to quit. This was what it looked like when someone gave absolutely everything—no reservations, no holding back, complete commitment to the moment.

I'd never seen anything like it. Had never witnessed this level of physical suffering willingly embraced. Every stroke looked like it might be the last Cameron could manage, and yet somehow another one followed, and another, relentless and brutal and beautiful in its intensity.

"Three hundred meters!"

I could see the finish line now, marked by flags and a timing system at the end of the two-thousand-meter course. The boats were so close. So painfully, agonizingly close. And still dead even, neither crew able to break the other, both suffering in perfect equilibrium.

Then—impossibly, terrifyingly—Hadley surged.

Not much. Maybe half a boat length. But it was enough. I saw their bow pull ahead of Lakewood's, saw them take the lead with only three hundred meters remaining, saw the advantage that could decide everything.

The crowd around me gasped. I heard groans of dismay. Someone behind me cursed.

"Hadley takes the lead!" the announcer called. "Three hundred meters to go and Hadley Prep has the advantage! Can Lakewood respond?"

Cameron's response was immediate. I saw his stroke rate increase—faster pulls, more strokes per minute, demanding even more from a crew that had nothing left to give. The coxswain's voice carried across the water, audible in a brief lull in crowd noise: "Power twenty! Give me twenty strokes at sprint pace! Now!"

A power twenty. Twenty maximum-effort strokes. With three hundred meters left, it was everything or nothing. Lakewood was throwing everything into this final surge, burning every last reserve, leaving absolutely nothing in the tank.

I watched Cameron drive that killing pace, watched his back working with mechanical precision despite exhaustion, watched him refuse to accept defeat. Watched the seven rowers behind him match his pace, mirror his determination, pull themselves through pain toward that finish line.

The boat surged. Slowly, agonizingly, Lakewood began to claw back the distance.

"Two hundred fifty meters! Lakewood making a move! They're coming back!"

The crowd lost its collective mind. The roar reached a fever pitch. People were jumping, screaming, grabbing each other. Rachel was yelling something I couldn't hear over the noise. I stood frozen, hands clenched into fists, barely breathing.

The boats drove forward. Stroke after brutal stroke. Lakewood gaining inches with each pull. Hadley fighting to maintain their lead. Both crews suffering beyond anything I could imagine, both refusing to break.

"Two hundred meters! Lakewood has pulled even! We are dead even with two hundred meters to go!"

My heart hammered so hard it hurt. Two hundred meters. Less than a minute of rowing. One minute that felt like an eternity.

Cameron increased the pace again. I didn't know how—didn't know where he found the strength or how his body could possibly move faster when it had already given everything. But somehow he did, somehow he demanded more, and somehow his crew responded.

The boats were sprinting now. An all-out, desperate, nothing-held-back sprint to the finish. Eight rowers in each boat pulling with abandon, technique starting to break down under exhaustion, just raw power and willpower driving them forward.

"One hundred fifty meters!"

I could see individual oar strokes now. Could see water flying. Could see the boats rocketing toward the finish line in a blur of motion and spray and desperate effort.

Lakewood's bow inched ahead. Then Hadley's. Then Lakewood's again. Back and forth, neither able to establish control, both giving absolutely everything.

"One hundred meters!" The announcer was screaming now, caught up in the drama. "This is going to be a photo finish! These crews are dead even!"

The final hundred meters felt like they took hours. Every stroke an eternity. Every inch gained or lost crucial. The boats driving forward with mechanical violence, no rhythm anymore, just pure suffering and refusal to stop.

"Fifty meters!"

The crowd was beyond coherent noise. Just a wall of sound, a collective scream of tension and hope and desperation.

Lakewood's bow pulled ahead by inches. Cameron driving impossible pace, his whole body working with brutal efficiency. The team responding with everything left. The boat surging in one final, desperate push.

"Twenty meters! Lakewood has the lead! Inches ahead!"

The finish line rushed at them. I stopped breathing entirely. Stopped thinking. Just watched those final strokes with every muscle in my body tensed.

Cameron pulled one final time. The boat shot forward. Hadley made one last desperate surge alongside them.

The bows crossed the line within a fraction of a second of each other. So close I couldn't tell who'd won. So close it looked like they'd crossed simultaneously.

Then it was over.

The boats glided past the finish line, momentum carrying them forward even as the rowers collapsed over their oars. Eight bodies in each boat slumping forward, chests heaving, completely spent.

The crowd went silent for one horrible moment, everyone waiting for the official result.

Then the announcer's voice: "Lakewood Academy wins by four-tenths of a second! Four-tenths of a second! What a race! Ladies and gentlemen, that is championship rowing!"

The lakeshore exploded. The noise was deafening. Students screaming, faculty cheering, alumni hugging each other. Pure jubilation erupting from hundreds of people simultaneously.

Rachel grabbed me and screamed something I couldn't hear, jumping up and down. Around us, everyone was celebrating, the tension of the race breaking into pure joy.

But I couldn't join them yet. Could only stare out at the water where Lakewood's boat drifted, where eight rowers slumped over their oars in complete exhaustion, where Cameron sat at stroke seat with his back still to me, shoulders heaving as he tried to catch his breath after the most brutal six minutes of his life.

They'd won. By less than half a second, by the narrowest possible margin, by a photo finish that could have gone either way. But they'd won.

Despite the drama. Despite the tension. Despite choosing me and dealing with all the consequences—the team fractures, the distraction, the pressure, the judgment. Despite everything that should have broken their focus and cost them the race. Cameron had somehow found a way to row the race of his life when everything was on the line, to push through pain and exhaustion and deliver exactly when it mattered most.

The relief hit me so hard my knees went weak. Rachel caught my arm, steadying me, grinning through tears of her own.

"They did it," she said, or maybe shouted—I could barely hear over the celebration around us. "Sophie, they actually did it!"

On the water, the Lakewood crew was starting to recover enough to celebrate. I saw fists raised, saw teammates reaching forward to clasp hands, saw the boat rocking dangerously as they hugged each other despite the coxswain's protests.

And Cameron—Cameron looked around at his team, at the boat that had just won the most important race of their season by the narrowest possible margin, at his teammates who'd somehow pulled together despite a week of tension and found a way to win.

Then he looked toward shore. Scanning the crowd. Searching.

Looking for me.

Our eyes met across the distance, and even from here I could see his expression transform. Exhaustion and pain and relief and joy all mixed together. He raised one hand in a small wave—just for me, a private acknowledgment in the middle of this very public celebration.

I waved back, tears streaming down my face, grinning like an idiot.

He'd done it. They'd done it. Against all odds, despite everything stacked against them, they'd found a way to win.

And now the real test would begin—what came next, how Cameron would handle the post-race celebration, whether he'd really go through with making our relationship fully public in front of everyone.

But for this moment, watching him on that boat surrounded by his celebrating team, I let myself just feel the pure joy of watching someone I loved succeed at something that mattered to them.

The race was over. Against all odds, impossibly, Lakewood had won.

And whatever came next, we'd face it together.
