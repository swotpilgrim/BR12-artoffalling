# Chapter 1: Arrival

The passenger door of my mother's Honda Civic creaked when I opened it, a familiar sound that suddenly felt like an embarrassment. Around us, luxury sedans and SUVs glided to smooth stops in front of Lakewood Academy's ivy-covered administration building, disgorging students in expensive preppy clothes and parents who looked like they'd stepped out of a catalog.

"You have everything?" Mom's voice was steady, but I caught the tight edge underneath. She'd taken the morning off from her shift at the diner—unpaid hours she couldn't really afford to lose.

"I'm good." I pulled my single duffel bag from the backseat, the canvas worn soft from years of use. Through the rear window, I could see a family unloading what looked like six matching leather suitcases from a gleaming Mercedes.

Mom got out and came around the car. For a moment we just stood there on the pristine brick walkway, surrounded by families who belonged here in ways we clearly didn't. She reached up and tucked a strand of hair behind my ear, the same gesture she'd done since I was little.

"You earned this, Sophie. Don't forget that." Her brown eyes were fierce. "You're as smart as any kid here."

"I know." The scholarship letter had said the same thing—academic excellence, outstanding potential. It hadn't mentioned that the scholarship didn't quite cover everything, or that Mom had picked up a third job stocking shelves at night to make up the difference.

"Call me Sunday, okay? There are phone cards in your bag."

"I will." My throat felt tight. "You should go. You'll hit traffic."

She pulled me into a hug that smelled like the floral lotion she always wore, familiar and safe. "I'm proud of you, honey."

Then she was getting back in the Honda, and I stood there watching her drive away, the engine making that rattling sound it had been making for the past six months. Around me, other families lingered—taking photos, laughing, clearly in no hurry. No one else seemed to be here alone.

I hitched my duffel higher on my shoulder and started across campus.

The grounds were exactly like the brochure photos: red brick buildings covered in ivy, sprawling green lawns, enormous oak trees just beginning to turn gold at the edges. September sunshine made everything look like a painting of what a boarding school should be. Students moved in clusters, calling to each other, their voices carrying that easy confidence of people who'd done this before.

I followed the hand-drawn map they'd sent me, trying not to stare at the parade of expensive luggage rolling past. A girl about my age walked by in a cable-knit sweater that probably cost more than my entire wardrobe, chatting on a cell phone while her father managed three rolling suitcases behind her. Another family posed for pictures in front of a building with "Reid Library" carved into the stone above the entrance.

Whitman Hall sat at the far end of campus, a three-story brick building with white shutters and a slightly tired look compared to the gleaming academic buildings near the entrance. The lobby smelled like old wood and lemon cleaner. A bulletin board by the entrance displayed a floor plan with room assignments.

Third floor. Room 314. I took the stairs, my sneakers quiet on worn wood that creaked under my weight.

The hallway was chaos—girls hauling boxes, parents assembling lamps, music playing from open doorways. I found 314 halfway down and pushed open the door.

The room was small. Two narrow beds, two desks, two dressers, barely enough floor space to walk between them. The left side was already claimed—colorful comforter, crates of belongings stacked neatly, posters leaning against the wall waiting to be hung.

A girl looked up from where she was organizing items on her desk. She was Black, with her hair in neat braids pulled back in a ponytail, wearing jeans and a Lakewood sweatshirt that looked new.

"You must be Sophie." She gave me a quick assessing look that reminded me of the way my mother sized up customers at the diner—efficient, reading more than just surface details. "I'm Rachel Morrison. Chicago."

"Milwaukee." I set my duffel on the bare mattress of the unclaimed bed.

"Scholarship?" Rachel asked it casually, but I heard the real question underneath.

"Yeah. Academic."

She nodded, something relaxing in her posture. "Same. Second year for me."

I unzipped my bag and started pulling out clothes. Rachel watched for a moment, then sat on her bed.

"Look, I'm going to give you the rundown now because nobody else will." She leaned back against her pillow, matter-of-fact. "There are about forty scholarship students in the whole school. Everyone else is legacy or full-pay. The school likes to pretend we're all the same, but we're not."

"Okay." I hung my thrift-store cardigan in the narrow closet.

"The dining hall has assigned tables by dorm house, but within that, people cluster. Legacy kids sit together. We sit at the far end. It's not official, just how it works." Rachel pulled one knee up to her chest. "Same thing everywhere. The library, the student center, social stuff. There are invisible lines."

"And we stay on our side?" I tried to keep the edge out of my voice.

"If you're smart." Rachel's expression wasn't unkind, just realistic. "I'm not saying people are mean. Mostly they're polite. But you're always going to be the scholarship kid to them. The one they're helping. The diversity they can put in their college essays."

I thought about the families I'd seen outside with their matching luggage and easy laughter. "Got it."

"It's not personal." Rachel stood and grabbed a poster from her stack. "I'm just saying, don't waste energy trying to fit in where you don't belong. Focus on your grades, get into a good college, get out. That's why we're here."

"Right." I pulled out my alarm clock—an old digital one with numbers that glowed too bright. Set it on the desk next to my three spiral notebooks and handful of pens.

Rachel hung her poster—a print of the Chicago skyline—and we worked in companionable silence. Through the open door, I could hear other girls greeting roommates, parents offering advice about class schedules, laughter echoing down the hall. Everyone else seemed to already know each other, already comfortable in this world.

"First dinner is mandatory," Rachel said as the afternoon light started to slant golden through our window. "Six o'clock. Dress code is enforced—no jeans."

I had one pair of khakis and two decent shirts. I pulled them out, hoping they weren't too wrinkled.

---

Carmichael Dining Hall was exactly as grand as the brochure photos suggested. Vaulted ceilings, massive windows overlooking the lake, long wooden tables that could seat twelve students each. Faculty sat at a raised head table, looking out over the room like benevolent observers.

Rachel led me to a table near the far wall. Five other students were already seated—a mix of ages, all with the same slightly uncertain look I imagined I wore. Introductions went around: James from Minneapolis, Maria from St. Paul, two sophomores whose names I immediately forgot.

"First year?" James asked me. He had dark hair and an easy smile, seemed more comfortable than the rest of us.

"Yeah. You?"

"Junior. Second year here." He passed me a basket of rolls. "It gets easier. The first few weeks are weird, but you figure it out."

Across the dining hall, I could see the tables Rachel had mentioned. Clusters of students who sat close together, talked loudly, laughed at inside jokes. They wore the same preppy uniform as everyone else—khakis and oxford shirts, cardigans and loafers—but somehow their clothes looked different. Better. Like they'd been born knowing how to tie a sweater over their shoulders just so.

One girl at the nearest table had blonde hair pulled back in a perfect ponytail, pearl earrings, a cashmere cardigan in soft pink. She was talking animatedly to a guy in a Lakewood crew sweatshirt, their whole group leaning in like she was the most interesting person in the world.

"That's Vanessa Price," Rachel said quietly, noticing where I was looking. "Legacy student. Her family has been coming here for four generations."

"She looks like she stepped out of a magazine."

"Most of them do." Rachel buttered her roll with careful precision. "You get used to it."

Dinner was served family-style—platters of roast chicken and vegetables passed around the table. The food was good, better than I'd expected. Around us, conversation flowed about classes and teachers, who was strict and who was lenient, which dorms had the best common rooms. I tried to follow along, tried to contribute when I could, but mostly I felt like I was watching from behind glass.

When dinner finally ended, I followed Rachel back to Whitman Hall through the September dusk. The campus looked magical in the fading light—old-fashioned street lamps flickering on, students strolling the paths in small groups, the lake in the distance turning silver.

"You okay?" Rachel asked as we climbed the stairs to our floor.

"Just tired."

She gave me a knowing look but didn't push.

In our room, I changed into pajamas and climbed into bed while Rachel settled at her desk with a book. Through the wall, I could hear girls in the next room laughing, music playing from somewhere down the hall. Footsteps in the corridor, voices calling goodnight, the sound of people who'd been doing this for years.

I stared at the ceiling, at the cracks in the old plaster, and wondered if I'd made a terrible mistake.

My mother was working the overnight shift right now, stocking shelves at the grocery store so I could be here. The scholarship had been such a gift when it came—a chance at something better, an opportunity she'd never had. She'd been so proud.

But lying here in this narrow bed, listening to the sounds of a world I didn't belong to, I wasn't sure pride was enough.

The girl in the cashmere cardigan probably never questioned whether she belonged at Lakewood. Her parents probably went here, and their parents before them. She probably had a room waiting for her at home that was bigger than this entire dorm, with a closet full of clothes I couldn't afford to even look at.

And I had a single duffel bag and a mother working three jobs.

I rolled over, facing the wall, and tried to ignore the homesickness rising in my throat. This was what I'd wanted—the best education, a path to a better future. I just hadn't realized how lonely that path would feel.

Somewhere down the hall, a group of girls burst into laughter. I closed my eyes and tried to sleep.
