# Chapter 17: Confrontation

I texted Cameron before the sun came up, unable to sleep anyway after lying awake most of the night replaying Tyler's words. The message was simple: *Can you meet me at The Point? Early. Before breakfast.*

His response came within minutes: *I'll be there.*

The November morning was cold enough that my breath formed clouds in the air as I walked across campus. Most of Lakewood was still asleep, windows dark in the dorms, the dining hall silent. The only sounds were the crunch of frost-crisp leaves under my feet and the distant caw of crows in the bare trees. I pulled my jacket tighter and tried to organize the chaos of thoughts that had been spinning through my mind since I'd fled the party. All night, I'd rehearsed what I needed to say, but now that I was actually walking toward him, the words felt jumbled and insufficient.

Cameron was already at The Point when I arrived, sitting on our bench facing the lake. He stood when he heard me approach, and the worry on his face made my resolve waver for a dangerous second.

"Sophie." His voice was soft, concerned. "What's wrong? You disappeared last night. I looked for you everywhere."

Of course he had. Because Cameron was kind and responsible and everything his friends thought he was. Too nice to realize he was being taken advantage of.

I sat down on the bench, needing the distance even though what I really wanted was to walk into his arms and pretend none of this mattered. He sat beside me, careful not to crowd me but close enough that I could feel the warmth of him in the cold morning air.

"I overheard something last night," I said, staring out at the lake instead of at him. "At the party. I went looking for the bathroom and there was a conversation happening around the corner. Tyler and some other people from the crew team. Some girls."

Cameron's body went still. "What did you hear?"

"They were talking about you. About us." I made myself look at him then, needing to see his face. "Tyler said you've been distracted all season. That you're spending too much time with 'that scholarship girl.'"

Cameron's jaw tightened. "Tyler doesn't—"

"Let me finish." My voice came out harder than I intended. "Someone asked if we were dating. Tyler laughed. He said you wouldn't be that stupid."

The words hung between us in the cold air. Cameron looked like I'd hit him.

"They think I'm using you," I continued, the hurt fresh even though I'd had hours to sit with it. "Social climbing. Angling for access to your world, your money, your connections. One girl said I'm obviously hoping to land a rich boyfriend to solve all my problems."

"Sophie—"

"Tyler said you're too nice to realize I'm taking advantage." I was on a roll now, all the pain and humiliation pouring out. "That these scholarship kids—we're here for opportunity, and you're the ultimate opportunity. Fourth-generation legacy, family money, connections at every major university. He said you feel responsible for me because of the mentorship thing, but you don't realize what I'm really after."

Cameron's hands were clenched into fists on his knees. "None of that is true. Tyler doesn't know what he's talking about. He doesn't know you."

"But he's your best friend," I said quietly. "The person whose opinion probably matters most to you. And that's what he thinks of me. Of us."

"I don't care what Tyler thinks." Cameron turned to face me fully, his blue eyes intense. "I know you, Sophie. I know this isn't about money or connections or anything they said. What we have is real."

"Is it?" The question came out sharper than I meant it to. "Because it's real in secret, Cameron. When we're alone here or hidden away in the library. But out there, in the actual world, we don't exist. You don't acknowledge me as anything more than your mentee. We can't even look at each other at a party without it being weird."

"That's to protect you," he said, frustration creeping into his voice. "To keep you from having to deal with exactly what you dealt with last night. The gossip, the judgment—"

"I'm already dealing with it!" I stood up, too agitated to sit still. "They're already talking about me, making assumptions, deciding who I am and what I want. The only difference is that right now, I'm someone you're too nice to realize is using you. If we were actually together—publicly together—at least I'd be your girlfriend. At least it would be real instead of this half-existence where I'm your secret."

Cameron stood too, closing the distance between us. "You think I want to hide you? That I'm ashamed of you?"

"I think you're not willing to risk your reputation for me," I said, and my voice broke on the last word. "I think when it comes down to it, you're choosing to keep this quiet because it's easier than dealing with what your friends think, what your teammates think, what your family would think."

"That's not fair." His voice was rough with emotion. "You have no idea what kind of pressure—"

"Then tell me." I looked up at him, feeling tears threaten but refusing to let them fall. "Tell me you're willing to go public. To tell Tyler and your crew team and everyone at Lakewood that we're together. That I'm not just your charity project but someone who actually matters to you."

The silence stretched between us, broken only by the sound of small waves lapping against the rocky shore. I watched Cameron's face, saw the war playing out in his expression—the desire to say yes fighting against something else. Fear, maybe. Or practicality. Or the weight of all those expectations he'd been raised with.

"It's not that simple," he finally said.

Those four words felt like a door slamming shut.

"Why not?" I asked, even though I already knew the answer. "If what we have is real, if it matters, why isn't it that simple?"

"Because going public would make both our lives harder." Cameron ran a hand through his hair, frustration evident in every line of his body. "The gossip would be relentless. Every time we were together, people would be watching, judging, making assumptions. Your life would become even more difficult—"

"Don't pretend this is about protecting me," I said quietly. "This is about you not wanting to deal with the consequences. About not wanting to rock the boat or complicate your perfect life or risk your college prospects if it becomes campus drama."

"That's not—" He stopped, and I saw the truth in his eyes. The hesitation. The calculation of costs and benefits.

"You're choosing your reputation," I said, and it wasn't an accusation anymore. Just a sad observation. "Your comfortable life where everything is planned out and perfect and exactly what everyone expects from Cameron Reid. You'd rather keep me as your secret than risk any of that."

"Sophie, I care about you." His voice was desperate now. "You have to know that."

"I do know that," I said, and I meant it. "But caring isn't enough. Not when caring means I have to accept being hidden. Not when it means existing in this limbo where we're something when we're alone and nothing when anyone's watching."

I took a breath, steadying myself for what I needed to say next. "I can't do this anymore, Cameron. I won't be the girl you're too ashamed to be seen with."

"I'm not ashamed of you." He reached for my hand but I stepped back.

"Then prove it," I said. "Tell your friends. Sit with me at dinner. Walk across campus holding my hand. Choose me publicly, not just in secret."

The words hung between us like a challenge. Cameron's face was anguished, and I could see how much this was costing him. But I could also see that he wasn't going to do it. Wasn't ready to choose me over everything else.

The silence was answer enough.

"I think we should end the mentorship," I said, my voice surprisingly steady. "We should stop seeing each other. It's too complicated, and I can't—I won't—keep doing this."

"Sophie, please." Cameron's voice broke. "Don't do this. Give me time to figure out—"

"Figure out what?" I asked. "How to have me without any of the consequences? That's not how this works, Cameron. You can't have it both ways."

"I just need—"

"You need to decide what matters more," I interrupted. "Your reputation and your perfect legacy student life, or this. Us. But I'm not going to wait around while you figure it out, existing in secret like something you're ashamed of."

I started walking away, back toward campus, my vision blurring with tears I'd been holding back. Behind me, I heard Cameron say my name, desperate and broken, but I didn't turn around. If I turned around, if I saw his face, I might lose my resolve. Might accept the crumbs he was offering instead of holding out for something real.

My feet carried me along the familiar path through the woods, back toward Whitman Hall where Rachel was probably still asleep. The morning sun was just starting to break through the trees, painting everything in shades of gold that felt wrong for how hollow I felt inside. Birds were starting to wake up, their calls too cheerful for how I was feeling.

I'd ended it. Chosen my dignity over being someone's secret. It was the right choice—I knew it was the right choice—but that didn't make it hurt any less. My chest ached like something physical had been torn away, leaving a raw wound that the cold morning air seemed to find with every breath.

Behind me, somewhere back at The Point, Cameron was probably still standing there. Alone on the bench where we'd spent so many stolen hours talking about everything and nothing, where he'd first kissed me under the stars, where I'd let myself believe that maybe we could find a way to make this work despite all the obstacles between us. He was realizing, maybe too late, that he'd lost me by being too afraid to choose me when it mattered.

I wiped at my eyes with the back of my hand and kept walking, leaving him and all those secret moments behind. Forward was the only direction left now.
