# Chapter 15: Secret

We agreed to keep it quiet. At least at first.

"Just until we figure out what this is," Cameron said the next morning over terrible coffee. We stood at our usual spot by the window, but everything felt different now. More charged. "We don't need everyone's opinions before we even know what we're doing."

"Agreed," I said, trying to ignore how my heart raced every time our hands almost touched.

"We can still meet. Study together. Be friends publicly." He lowered his voice. "And figure out the rest in private."

So that's what we did.

To everyone else, we were still just Cameron Reid and his mentee Sophie Bennett. Still study partners who met at the library. Still friends who grabbed coffee before first period.

But in the hidden spaces—The Point, empty library corners, the woods paths where no one walked—we were something else entirely.

It felt thrilling at first. Like we had a secret the rest of Lakewood didn't know. When Cameron's hand would brush mine as we walked to class, no one else understood the electricity of that contact. When our eyes met across the dining hall, we shared a private smile that belonged only to us.

The first time he kissed me, it was at The Point on a Tuesday evening. The sun was setting over the lake, painting everything gold and pink. We'd been sitting close, talking about nothing important, and then suddenly we weren't talking at all.

Cameron's hand came up to cup my face, gentle and tentative. "Is this okay?"

"Yes," I whispered.

The kiss was soft, careful, both of us aware we were crossing into new territory. His lips were warm despite the November cold. When we pulled apart, both slightly breathless, Cameron was smiling.

"I've wanted to do that for weeks," he admitted.

"Me too."

We kissed again, less tentative this time. And for that moment, with the sunset painting the sky and Cameron's arms around me, everything felt perfect.

But the secrecy started to wear on me almost immediately.

I felt guilty keeping this from Rachel. She'd been warning me for weeks about getting too attached to Cameron, and now I was not only attached but secretly dating him. Every time she asked how I was doing, I had to lie. Every time she noticed me checking my phone or smiling at a text, I had to deflect.

"You seem different lately," she observed one evening, watching me get ready to "study at the library."

"Different how?"

"Happier. But also more distracted." Rachel's eyes were knowing. "Anything you want to talk about?"

"Just school stuff. Chemistry exam coming up."

She didn't look convinced, but she didn't push.

The lying felt wrong. Rachel was my friend. She deserved honesty. But telling her meant facing all the warnings I wasn't ready to hear, all the very valid concerns about dating Cameron Reid.

So I kept the secret and tried to ignore the guilt.

Cameron struggled too, though for different reasons.

One afternoon, I watched from across the quad as Tyler called Cameron over to where a group of crew guys were hanging out. Cameron glanced at me, and for a moment I thought he might wave me over too, include me in whatever they were doing.

Instead, he gave me an apologetic smile and headed toward his friends alone.

It shouldn't have stung. We'd agreed to be subtle. But watching Cameron laugh with Tyler and the others, not acknowledging me standing twenty feet away, made me feel invisible.

Later, when we met at The Point, I tried to bring it up.

"You could have introduced me. To your crew friends this afternoon."

"Tyler would have made it weird. You know how he is about us spending time together."

"So instead I just stand there ignored?"

"You're not ignored. We're just being careful." Cameron's voice was patient but firm. "We agreed, Sophie. Keep things quiet until we know what this is."

"I know what this is."

"Do you?" He asked it gently. "Because we've been dating for a week. We're still figuring things out."

He was right. But it didn't make the feeling go away—that maybe Cameron was ashamed of me. That the secrecy wasn't about privacy but about protecting his reputation.

The hidden moments were intense. Stolen kisses in empty library stacks. Whispered conversations at The Point as darkness fell. Cameron's hand finding mine in the woods where no one could see.

But they were also fragile. Every secret meeting felt like it could be our last. Every close call—when another student walked past our spot, when someone almost caught us holding hands—reminded me how tenuous this was.

We existed in a bubble, and I wasn't sure how long it could last.

"I told Vanessa," Cameron admitted one evening.

We were at The Point, sitting close enough that our shoulders touched. The late November air was freezing, but neither of us wanted to leave yet.

"You did?"

"She asked if something was going on between us. I couldn't lie to her." Cameron squeezed my hand. "She's happy for us. Said she already knew anyway."

"What about Tyler? Your other friends?"

"Not yet." His jaw tightened. "Tyler would make it a whole thing. Start asking questions, making judgments. I'm not ready for that."

"So I'm a secret from everyone except your ex-girlfriend?"

"That's not fair."

"Isn't it?" I pulled my hand back. "You told Vanessa because she already figured it out. But everyone else—your actual friends, your team—you're hiding me from them."

"I'm protecting us. There's a difference."

"Is there?" The doubt had been building for days, and now it spilled out. "Because from where I'm sitting, it feels like you're ashamed of being with me. Like I'm fine in private but not something you want people to know about."

Cameron's expression tightened. "That's not true."

"Then why are we hiding?"

"Because telling people makes it real. Makes it public. Makes it something everyone has opinions about." He ran a hand through his hair, frustrated. "Right now, this is ours. Just yours and mine. The second we tell people, it becomes about social hierarchies and what makes sense and Tyler's judgments and all the reasons why we supposedly shouldn't work."

"Maybe I don't care about all that."

"Well, I do." Cameron's voice was sharp. "I care that the second people know, they'll start treating you differently. Making assumptions about why you're with me. Saying you're using me for money or connections or social climbing. I'm trying to protect you from that."

"I don't need protecting. I need honesty."

"This is honest. Us, right here, right now. This is the most honest thing in my life."

"But you won't acknowledge it publicly."

"Not yet. Not until we're solid enough to handle everyone else's opinions."

"When will that be? A month from now? A semester? Never?"

Cameron didn't answer, and the silence felt heavy.

We sat there in the cold darkness, and for the first time since we'd admitted our feelings, the space between us felt more like distance than intimacy.

"I don't know how long I can do this," I finally said. "The hiding. The pretending we're just friends when people are watching. The feeling like I'm something you're ashamed of."

"I'm not ashamed of you."

"Then act like it."

"Sophie—"

"I should get back. It's late." I stood, pulling my jacket tighter against the cold.

Cameron stood too, reaching for my hand. I let him take it, but the warmth that usually came with his touch felt muted.

"I don't want to fight," he said quietly.

"I don't either."

"Can we talk about this? Figure out a compromise?"

"Maybe. I don't know." I was tired suddenly. Tired of hiding, tired of doubting, tired of wondering if this thing between us was strong enough to survive being real. "I just need to think."

"Okay." Cameron's voice was resigned. "Tomorrow? Our usual coffee?"

"Yeah. Tomorrow."

He walked me back toward campus, but we didn't hold hands. Didn't talk. Just moved through the darkness in uncomfortable silence.

At the edge of the woods, Cameron stopped.

"I care about you," he said. "More than I've cared about anyone. This isn't about shame or hiding or being embarrassed. It's about trying to protect something good before the world makes it complicated."

"It's already complicated, Cameron. We're just pretending it's not."

I left him standing there and walked back to Whitman Hall alone.

Rachel was already in bed when I got to our room, but I could tell she wasn't asleep.

"Long study session?" she asked.

"Yeah."

"Sophie?"

"Yeah?"

"Whatever you're dealing with, I'm here. When you're ready to talk about it."

The kindness in her voice nearly broke me. "Thanks, Rachel."

I changed for bed and lay there in the dark, replaying the conversation at The Point. Cameron's frustration. My doubt. The first real conflict we'd had since admitting our feelings.

He was trying to protect us. I understood that intellectually. But emotionally, the secrecy felt like shame. Like I wasn't good enough to acknowledge publicly.

And I didn't know how long I could be with someone who kept me hidden.

My phone buzzed. A text from Cameron: *I'm sorry. Let's talk tomorrow. Please.*

I stared at the message for a long time before responding: *Okay. Tomorrow.*

But as I set my phone down and tried to sleep, I wasn't sure tomorrow would fix this.

Because the fundamental problem remained: Cameron and I existed in two different worlds. And while we could pretend those worlds didn't matter when it was just the two of us, the second we stepped outside our bubble, reality crashed in.

Cameron wanted to stay in the bubble. To keep this thing between us private and protected.

And I was starting to wonder if staying hidden meant it wasn't real at all.

Or if maybe the real question was whether Cameron Reid was brave enough to choose me—publicly, openly, despite all the complications—when the time came to stop hiding.

Because I was falling for him. Genuinely, deeply falling.

And I needed to know if he was falling too.

Or if I was just someone he cared about in secret, but would never claim in the light.
