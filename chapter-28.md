# Chapter 28: Celebration

The regatta celebration moved to the lawn outside the Reid Boathouse, where refreshment tables had been set up and music played from speakers someone had brought. The November afternoon was cold but clear, the kind of perfect late-fall day that made you grateful for sunshine even if it didn't bring much warmth.

Cameron kept me close the entire time—his hand on the small of my back, or holding mine, or his arm around my shoulders. Constant, public contact that left absolutely no room for anyone to misunderstand our relationship status. Every touch was a declaration: *She's with me. This is real. Deal with it.*

People came up to congratulate him constantly. Students, faculty, alumni who'd traveled to watch the race. And Cameron introduced me to every single one of them. Not as his mentee. Not as a friend. As his girlfriend.

"This is Sophie," he'd say, pride clear in his voice. "My girlfriend."

Some people were genuinely welcoming. Smiled, shook my hand, made small talk about the race or classes or campus life. They treated me like I belonged there, like Cameron dating me was perfectly normal and unremarkable.

Others were politely distant. Cordial but cool, their smiles not quite reaching their eyes. They congratulated Cameron, acknowledged me with a nod, then moved on quickly. Not openly hostile, but making it clear they didn't approve of this breach in social boundaries.

I tried not to let it bother me. Tried to focus on the people who were kind, on Cameron's unwavering presence beside me, on the fact that we were here together and he wasn't hiding me anymore.

"Sophie Bennett." Tyler appeared beside us, two plastic cups of punch in hand. He offered one to me. "Peace offering?"

I took it, cautious. "Thanks."

"I owe you an apology," Tyler said, direct and honest. "Actually, I owe you several. For what I said at the party about you using Cameron. For the things I said to Cameron about you being a distraction. For assuming I knew what was best for my friend when clearly I didn't."

"Tyler—" Cameron started, but Tyler held up a hand.

"Let me finish." He looked at me. "I was wrong. About you, about your motivations, about what you mean to Cameron. I let prejudice and assumptions cloud my judgment, and I'm sorry for that."

"Apology accepted," I said, meaning it.

Tyler extended his hand again—a real handshake this time, not just politeness. "Friends?"

"Friends," I agreed.

He grinned, some of the tension leaving his shoulders. "Good. Because Cam's been miserable for weeks worrying about this, and I'd rather have my actual friend back instead of the stressed-out robot he's been."

Cameron laughed. "I wasn't that bad."

"You were worse," Tyler said. "But you rowed like a champion today, so I'll forgive you for being emotionally complicated."

They talked rowing for a minute—splits and stroke rates and technique details I didn't fully understand. But I didn't mind. Just stood there with Cameron's arm around me, listening to him talk with his best friend, feeling the fracture between them healing in real time.

"Sophie!" Vanessa Price approached, looking elegant even in casual post-race clothes. "Can I steal you for a second?"

Cameron looked questioningly at me, and I nodded. He squeezed my hand and went back to talking with Tyler about the race.

Vanessa led me a few steps away, far enough for privacy but still within Cameron's line of sight. "I wanted to congratulate you both. That took real courage—what you did today, showing up despite knowing everyone would be watching and judging."

"Thank you," I said, not sure where this was going.

"I meant what I said before," Vanessa continued. "You make Cameron happy. Really happy. I've known him since we were kids, and I've never seen him this... alive. This authentic." She smiled. "It's good. What you two have. Don't let anyone make you doubt that."

"I won't," I said, surprised by how much her words meant.

"Good." Vanessa glanced over at Cameron, who was watching us with barely concealed protectiveness. "He's been through a lot this week. The team tension, the social pressure, worrying about the race. But every time I saw him, even when he was stressed, there was this certainty underneath. Like he'd made a choice he was at peace with."

"He chose me," I said quietly. "Even when it was hard."

"And you chose him," Vanessa pointed out. "Even when you could have walked away. That matters just as much."

Dr. Hartley found us next, her eyes bright with approval. "Sophie, Cameron. Could I borrow you both?"

We walked a few steps away from the main celebration, Dr. Hartley between us. "I wanted to tell you how proud I am of you both. What you've done—choosing honesty over convenience, authenticity over performance—that's harder than most people ever manage."

"It hasn't been easy," Cameron admitted.

"The things worth doing rarely are," Dr. Hartley said. "But you're showing this community that the social boundaries we've accepted for so long aren't as fixed as everyone thinks. You're challenging people to question their assumptions. That's important work, even if it doesn't feel like it when you're just trying to be together."

She looked at me specifically. "Sophie, you've grown tremendously since September. You came here uncertain and guarded, and now look at you—standing beside Cameron at the biggest event of the year, facing judgment with grace. That's real courage."

Coach Anderson appeared as Dr. Hartley was leaving, still riding the high of the victory. He shook Cameron's hand vigorously. "Reid, you rowed the race of your life out there. I don't know what was different today, but whatever it was, you need to bottle it."

Cameron glanced at me, a smile tugging at his lips. "I think I know what it was, Coach."

Anderson followed his gaze, took in our joined hands, and nodded slowly. "Well then. Whatever works. Just keep rowing like that."

It was the most straightforward acceptance we'd gotten—no commentary on our relationship, no judgment about social boundaries, just acknowledgment that Cameron had delivered when it mattered and that was what counted.

Then I saw them. A well-dressed couple in their forties making their way across the lawn, clearly looking for someone. The woman had Cameron's eyes. The man had his jaw line.

Cameron saw them at the same moment. His hand tightened on mine.

"My parents," he said quietly. "They drove up for the race."

My stomach dropped. Meeting Cameron's parents—legacy Lakewood graduates, prominent Wisconsin family, people who probably had very specific ideas about who their son should date. This felt bigger and scarier than the entire school watching us kiss.

"Cameron!" His mother reached us first, pulling him into a hug. "That was incredible! We're so proud of you!"

His father clapped him on the shoulder. "Excellent rowing, son. Really excellent."

They were so focused on Cameron that they almost didn't notice me standing there. Almost.

Then his mother's eyes landed on our joined hands, traveled up to my face, and I saw her expression shift to polite confusion.

Cameron didn't give her time to ask. "Mom, Dad, this is Sophie Bennett. My girlfriend."

The word hung in the air. Girlfriend. Not friend, not classmate, not study partner. Girlfriend.

His parents exchanged a quick glance—the kind of wordless communication that came from years of marriage. Then his mother extended her hand to me, smile in place even though her eyes were uncertain.

"Sophie. How lovely to meet you."

"You too, Mrs. Reid." I shook her hand, trying not to let my nervousness show.

"You attend Lakewood?" his father asked, the question innocent but weighted.

"Yes, sir. I'm a junior. Scholarship student."

There it was. Out in the open. No pretending to be something I wasn't, no hiding my background. Just the truth.

Another glance between Cameron's parents. His mother's smile became slightly more strained. "How nice. And how did you and Cameron meet?"

"I was her peer mentor," Cameron said, his voice easy but firm. "We've been dating for a few months."

"I see," his father said, in a tone that suggested he didn't see at all but was too polite to say so.

The conversation that followed was cordial but awkward. Cameron's parents asked me polite questions about my classes, my plans for college, where I was from. I answered honestly, aware of them assessing me with every response, trying to figure out what their son saw in this scholarship student from Milwaukee.

Cameron didn't apologize for me. Didn't over-explain our relationship or try to justify his choice. Just stood beside me with his arm around my waist, treating my presence as a simple fact they needed to accept.

After a few minutes, his parents made polite excuses about needing to talk to Coach Anderson, promising to catch up with Cameron later. They walked away, and I could see them immediately putting their heads together in quiet conversation.

"That was terrifying," I said once they were out of earshot.

"You were perfect," Cameron said firmly. "And they'll come around. They just need time to adjust."

"Do you really think so?"

"I don't know," he admitted. "But even if they don't, it doesn't change anything. I meant what I said—I choose you. My parents' approval would be nice, but it's not required."

The celebration continued around us—teammates laughing, alumni reminiscing, faculty enjoying the rare beautiful day. Cameron and I stood in the middle of it all, together and public and real.

"Want to get out of here?" Cameron asked eventually. "I love these people, but I need a break from being 'on.'"

"The Point?" I suggested.

He grinned. "Read my mind."

We slipped away from the celebration as the sun began its descent toward the horizon, painting the lake in shades of gold and orange. Hand in hand, we walked toward the woods, toward our place, toward the privacy we'd been craving all afternoon.

Behind us, the party continued. Ahead, The Point waited—our bench, our lake, our space to just be ourselves without performing for anyone.

And for the first time all day, I felt like I could breathe.
