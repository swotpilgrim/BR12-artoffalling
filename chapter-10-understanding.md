# Chapter 10: Understanding

November settled over Lakewood with cold rain and grey skies that made the campus feel smaller, more intimate. Students hurried between buildings with jackets pulled tight, and the common rooms filled with people seeking warmth and company.

Cameron and I found our own spaces—quiet corners where we could talk without the weight of social hierarchies and watchful eyes.

The Point became our regular meeting place. Two or three times a week, we'd end up there in the late afternoon, sitting on the weathered bench as daylight faded and the temperature dropped. We'd talk about everything and nothing—complaints about impossible homework assignments, anxiety about upcoming exams, dreams about futures that felt both exciting and terrifying.

"Dr. Martinez assigned another ten-page paper," Cameron said one Tuesday, his breath visible in the cold air. "On top of the chemistry lab report and the calculus problem sets. I don't think they realize we're humans who need sleep."

"Patterson wants us to read three hundred pages of Victorian literature by Friday," I countered. "Plus write a comparative analysis. I'm going to be in the library until midnight every night this week."

"Want company? I need to be there anyway."

"You don't have to—"

"I know I don't have to. I want to." He smiled. "Besides, misery loves company. We can suffer through homework together."

That became another pattern—long evenings in the library, our study carrels pushed close together, working in companionable silence broken by occasional complaints or questions. Cameron would help me parse Victorian novels, finding themes and symbolism I'd missed. I'd read his debate arguments, pointing out weak spots in his logic and suggesting stronger evidence.

"You're really good at this," he said one night, looking at the notes I'd scribbled in the margins of his paper. "Finding the holes in arguments. You should join debate team."

"Pretty sure that's your world, not mine."

"Could be both our worlds." He met my eyes. "You're smart, Sophie. Smarter than half the people on the team. You'd be good at it."

I felt my cheeks warm. "Maybe next semester."

"I'll hold you to that."

The conversations ranged beyond homework. Cameron told me stories about his family that revealed complications I'd never imagined—a father whose approval was always conditional, a mother who threw perfect dinner parties but never asked how he was actually feeling, expectations that felt more like chains than support.

"My sister calls every Sunday," he said during one of our Point conversations. "She always sounds exhausted. Yale's crushing her, but she can't admit it because Reids don't struggle. We excel."

"That's not healthy."

"No. But it's tradition." He picked up a stone, weighing it in his palm. "She told me once that she wishes she'd gone somewhere else. Somewhere no one knew the family name. Somewhere she could just be herself without the legacy hanging over everything."

"Why didn't she?"

"Same reason I probably won't. Because disappointing our father isn't really an option. Because the expectations have been there our whole lives. Because it's easier to perform the role than to fight for something different."

I thought about my own mother—working three jobs, sacrificing everything so I could be here. Different pressure, but I understood the weight of someone else's hopes resting on your shoulders.

"We're both performing," I said quietly. "Me trying to prove I belong here, you trying to live up to a legacy. Neither of us gets to just be ourselves."

"Except maybe here." Cameron gestured at The Point, at the privacy it offered. "This is the one place I don't have to be Cameron Reid, Princeton legacy, crew captain with all the answers. I can just be... me."

"Terrified and uncertain?"

"Exactly." He smiled, and it was genuine. "It's actually kind of a relief."

We understood each other in ways that surprised me. The specific pressures were different, but the fundamental fear was the same—not being enough, not deserving the opportunities we had, constantly wondering if we were frauds who'd eventually be exposed.

Rachel noticed, of course.

"You're spending a lot of time with him," she observed one evening, watching me check my reflection before heading to the library.

"We're study partners."

"Sophie." Rachel set down her textbook. "Study partners don't look at each other the way you two do."

"I don't know what you're talking about."

"Yes, you do." Her voice was gentle but insistent. "I'm not saying it's bad. I'm just saying be careful. Cameron Reid lives in a different world. When this semester ends, when applications are in, when the regatta is over—he's going back to that world. You need to be prepared for that."

"We're friends, Rachel. Real friends."

"I hope so." She didn't sound convinced. "I just don't want to see you get hurt."

But I couldn't make myself pull back. Cameron had become the best part of my Lakewood experience—the person who made this place feel less impossible, who saw me as more than the scholarship girl, who trusted me with his own vulnerabilities.

And if I was honest with myself, I was starting to feel things that went beyond friendship. The way my heart sped up when I saw him across the dining hall. The way I found myself watching for him between classes. The disappointment I felt when crew practice ran late and we couldn't meet at The Point.

I told myself it was just gratitude. He'd been kind when he didn't have to be. Of course I felt attached.

But I knew it was more than that.

Cameron seemed to be struggling with something similar. I'd catch him staring at me during our library study sessions, his expression thoughtful and slightly confused. He'd seek me out with increasing frequency—before classes, between periods, finding excuses to check in that had nothing to do with mentoring.

Tyler noticed too.

"You're missing guys' night again?" I heard him say one Thursday as I passed their table in the dining hall. "For library time with her?"

Cameron's response was too quiet for me to catch, but Tyler's laugh was pointed. "Whatever you say, man. Just seems like you've got your priorities a little mixed up."

I pretended not to hear, but the comment stung. Mixed up priorities. Like spending time with me was a distraction from what really mattered.

That evening at The Point, I asked Cameron about it.

"Tyler thinks I'm spending too much time with you," he said, skipping stones across the dark water. "Says I'm neglecting my actual friends."

"Am I not your actual friend?"

"You are." He said it firmly. "You're more real than half the people I've known for years. Tyler just doesn't understand that friendship can exist across social lines."

"Does it bother you? That people are talking?"

"A little." Cameron sat back on the bench. "Not because I care what Tyler thinks, but because I hate that there have to be 'social lines' at all. That somehow you and I being friends is weird or inappropriate or whatever they think it is."

"Welcome to my world. Where everything is about lines and which side you're on."

"Yeah." He was quiet for a moment. "I'm sorry you have to deal with that."

"Not your fault."

"Still sorry."

We sat in silence as the sun set—earlier and earlier now that November was fading into December. The air was cold enough that I shivered despite my jacket.

"Here." Cameron shifted closer, creating a windbreak with his body. "Better?"

"A little."

We sat like that, closer than we'd ever been, our shoulders almost touching. I was acutely aware of every point where we nearly made contact—his arm inches from mine, his leg close enough that I could feel his warmth.

Cameron's hand rested on the bench between us. Mine was there too, just a few inches away.

Neither of us moved. Neither of us spoke.

But slowly, almost imperceptibly, Cameron shifted his hand closer. Just half an inch. Maybe less.

My heart was pounding so hard I was sure he could hear it. I didn't move, didn't breathe, just watched our hands in the fading light.

Another tiny shift. His pinky finger almost touching mine now.

The moment stretched between us—charged, expectant, terrifying. All I had to do was close that last tiny gap. Brush my hand against his. Acknowledge what was happening.

Instead, I pulled my hand back, tucking it into my jacket pocket.

Cameron pulled back too, looking away toward the water.

"Getting cold," I said, my voice sounding strange. "Should probably head back."

"Yeah. Right." Cameron stood quickly. "Early crew practice tomorrow anyway."

We walked back to campus in silence. Not the comfortable silence we usually shared, but something awkward and heavy. At the edge of campus, Cameron said goodnight and headed toward Morrison Hall without the usual lingering conversation.

I watched him go, my hand still tingling from the contact that never quite happened.

In our room, Rachel took one look at my face and said, "What happened?"

"Nothing." I kicked off my shoes and climbed into bed. "Absolutely nothing."

Which was the truth and also a lie.

Because something had almost happened. A line we'd almost crossed. An acknowledgment of what was growing between us that neither of us was quite ready to make.

And now I couldn't stop thinking about it.

About Cameron's hand moving closer to mine. About the way my entire body had responded to that tiny almost-touch. About the look on his face in that moment—nervous, hopeful, scared.

About the fact that I'd pulled away instead of closing the gap.

And about whether I'd made the right choice, or if I'd just missed the one moment when we could have been honest about what this was becoming.

I lay awake for hours, staring at the ceiling, replaying those few seconds over and over. Cameron's hand. My hand. The space between them that had felt both infinite and nonexistent.

Rachel was right to worry.

Because this was no longer about friendship or mentorship or gratitude.

This was something else entirely.

And I had absolutely no idea what to do about it.
