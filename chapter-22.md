# Chapter 22: Consequences

The gossip started immediately.

By Sunday morning, everyone at Lakewood seemed to have an opinion about Cameron Reid dating the scholarship girl. I heard it in the bathroom, in the hallways, passing between classes. Some of it was said directly to my face, most of it whispered just loud enough for me to hear.

"She must be thrilled. Dating a Reid? That's the ultimate social climb."

"I give it two weeks before his parents shut it down."

"Poor Cameron. He has no idea she's just using him."

I tried to ignore it, to remember what Cameron had said about not caring what people thought. But hearing your motives questioned and your character assassinated dozens of times a day wore you down in ways I hadn't anticipated.

Worse than the legacy students' whispers, though, was the distance from my own community. The scholarship students I'd been sitting with at dinner, the ones who'd welcomed me back after my time with Cameron—they pulled away.

"Guess you're too good for us now," one girl said when I tried to sit at our usual table for breakfast Monday morning.

"I'm not—" I started, but she'd already turned away.

James Parker was more direct when I ran into him at the library. "I get it, Sophie. You found a better option. Just don't pretend you're still one of us when you're holding hands with Cameron Reid at dinner."

"I am still one of us," I protested. "Dating Cameron doesn't change where I come from or who I am."

"It changes how everyone sees you," James said, not unkindly. "You made your choice. But don't expect us to celebrate you dating into the world that looks down on us."

That hurt worse than the legacy students' gossip. I wasn't trying to abandon my friends or pretend I was something I wasn't. I just cared about Cameron. But apparently, that was betrayal enough.

Rachel remained my anchor, thank God. She sat with me at meals even when other scholarship students moved away, walked with me across campus despite the stares, kept me grounded when I wanted to hide in my room and pretend none of this was happening.

"They'll come around," she said Tuesday evening as we walked back from dinner. "They're scared. Seeing you cross that social line makes them question whether the boundaries we've all accepted are as fixed as we thought. That's threatening."

"I'm not trying to threaten anyone," I said tiredly. "I'm just trying to be with someone I care about."

"I know. And they'll figure that out eventually." Rachel bumped my shoulder with hers. "For what it's worth, Cameron seems miserable too. This isn't easy for either of you."

She was right. Cameron was paying his own price for going public.

I heard about it from Rachel, who heard it from a girl who worked in the athletic office. The crew team's practice sessions were a disaster. Rowers who'd trained together for years suddenly couldn't synchronize. The boat that had moved like a single organism for months was now eight individuals pulling out of rhythm, unable to find their timing.

Wednesday afternoon, I had a clear view of the lake from my library window and watched practice for a few minutes. Even from a distance, I could see the jerky, uncoordinated movement of the boat. Could see Coach Anderson on the dock, hands on his hips, frustration evident in every line of his body.

And I felt guilty. The regatta was four days away, and I was the distraction that might cost them everything.

Thursday, Vanessa Price found me in the library.

"Sophie?" She stood at the end of my study carrel, looking uncertain. "Can I talk to you for a minute?"

I gestured to the empty chair, wary. Vanessa was Cameron's ex-girlfriend, perfectly suited to his world in every way I wasn't. I had no idea what she wanted.

"I just wanted to say—" She sat down, choosing her words carefully. "I think what you and Cameron are doing is brave. And I respect it."

I blinked, surprised. "You do?"

"I do." Vanessa smiled slightly. "Cameron and I dated last year. It was comfortable and easy and exactly what everyone expected. But there was no spark, you know? No real connection. We were together because it made sense on paper, not because we actually made each other happy."

"Okay," I said, not sure where this was going.

"But you make him happy," Vanessa continued. "Really happy. I've known Cameron since we were kids, and I've never seen him look at anyone the way he looks at you. Like you're the most important person in his world."

My throat felt tight. "Thank you for telling me that."

"It's not going to be easy," she warned. "People are talking, and not all of it is kind. His parents are probably going to have opinions. Some of his friends will never understand." She paused. "But I think he'd rather be happy with you and deal with the complications than be comfortable and miserable."

After Vanessa left, I sat there for a long time, thinking about her words. About how even Cameron's ex-girlfriend could see what we had was real, while so many others dismissed it as social climbing or misguided infatuation.

Friday afternoon, Dr. Hartley called me to her office.

"How are you handling everything?" she asked once I'd settled into the chair across from her desk.

"I'm okay," I said automatically, then corrected myself. "It's hard. Harder than I thought it would be. The gossip, the judgment, losing friends over this."

Dr. Hartley nodded. "I won't pretend it's going to get easier immediately. Lakewood has very entrenched ideas about social boundaries. You and Cameron are challenging those ideas, and people don't like having their worldview disrupted."

"I didn't mean to disrupt anyone's worldview," I said. "I just wanted to be with him."

"I know. But sometimes the most revolutionary act is simply being yourself and choosing what makes you happy, regardless of what others think you should do." She smiled. "You're handling the pressure better than most people would."

"It doesn't feel like it."

"That's because you're in the middle of it," Dr. Hartley said gently. "But Sophie, I've seen a lot of students come through Lakewood. Most of them conform to expectations, follow the prescribed path, never question the social structure. You're one of the few who's had the courage to choose differently."

"Is it worth it?" I asked quietly. "All this drama and stress and judgment—is it worth it for a relationship that might not even last?"

Dr. Hartley considered the question seriously. "Only you can answer that. But I'd ask you this: would you rather have tried and dealt with the consequences, or never tried and always wondered what might have been?"

I thought about Cameron. About how he made me feel seen and valued and brave. About the way he looked at me like I mattered more than his reputation or his family's expectations. About choosing authenticity over performance, even when authenticity was scary.

"I'd rather try," I said.

"Then you have your answer."

That evening, Cameron texted me: *Need to see you. The Point?*

I found him sitting on our bench as the sun set over the lake, painting everything in shades of orange and gold. He looked exhausted, shadows under his eyes, shoulders tense with stress.

"Hey," I said softly, sitting beside him.

"Hey." He pulled me close, and I felt him exhale like he'd been holding his breath. "Rough day?"

"Rough week," I corrected. "You?"

"Same." Cameron was quiet for a moment, staring out at the water. "Coach pulled me aside after practice today. Asked if my personal life was affecting my focus. If the drama was impacting my performance."

My stomach dropped. "What did you say?"

"I told him I was committed to the team and would row my best tomorrow." He paused. "But the truth is, practice has been terrible. We're not syncing. The boat feels wrong. And I know it's because of the tension I brought to the team."

"Cameron—"

"I'm not saying I regret going public," he interrupted. "I don't. But I can't pretend there aren't consequences. The team is suffering because of my choices."

I felt the weight of guilt settle heavier on my shoulders. "Maybe we should have waited. After the regatta, like Tyler said."

"No." Cameron turned to face me, his expression fierce. "If I'd waited, I would have been choosing their approval over you again. Choosing convenience over authenticity. I'm done doing that."

"But if the team loses tomorrow—"

"Then we lose," he said firmly. "And I'll take responsibility for whatever role I played in that. But Sophie, I can't live my life based on what might happen. I can't keep choosing the safe path just because it avoids potential consequences."

I leaned my head against his shoulder, feeling the solid warmth of him. "Everyone's talking about us. Scholarship students think I'm a sellout. Legacy students think I'm using you. The crew team thinks you're distracted. It's a mess."

"I know." He pressed a kiss to the top of my head. "And I'm sorry you're dealing with so much judgment. But I meant what I said—I choose you. Publicly. Proudly. No matter what anyone says."

We sat there as the sun disappeared below the horizon, holding each other while the temperature dropped and the stars began to appear. Tomorrow was the regatta. Tomorrow Cameron would race in front of everyone while they all watched to see if our relationship had destroyed the team's chances.

Tomorrow we'd find out if choosing honesty over performance came with a cost too high to bear.

But tonight, alone at The Point with Cameron's arms around me and nothing left to hide, I still believed we'd made the right choice. Even if it was the hard one. Even if it came with consequences neither of us had fully anticipated.

We'd chosen to be brave. To be real. To choose each other despite the cost.

And whatever happened tomorrow, at least we'd face it together.
