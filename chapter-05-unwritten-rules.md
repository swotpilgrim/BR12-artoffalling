# Chapter 5: Unwritten Rules

Over the next week, Cameron and I fell into a routine.

We'd meet for coffee at the student center before first period—terrible coffee from the vending machine that cost fifty cents. Cameron would already be there when I arrived, two cups waiting, and we'd stand at the counter by the window while he explained Lakewood's unwritten rules.

"Dress code is technically just 'neat and appropriate,'" he said on Tuesday morning, gesturing at his own outfit—khakis, oxford shirt, navy sweater. "But there's what's technically allowed and what people actually wear."

"Meaning?"

"Meaning jeans are allowed, but you'll notice most people wear khakis or corduroys. T-shirts are allowed, but people wear oxfords or polos. It's not written down anywhere, but everyone follows it."

I looked down at my own outfit—jeans and a plain blouse from Target. "So I'm breaking the unwritten code."

"You're fine." Cameron took a sip of his terrible coffee. "First-years get some leeway. But if you want to blend in, the preppy aesthetic is pretty standard. Khakis, cardigans, loafers. That kind of thing."

"All of which costs money."

He had the grace to look slightly uncomfortable. "Yeah. There's a thrift store in town if you need to supplement. Some scholarship students shop there."

Of course they did.

Wednesday, Cameron explained the academic hierarchy over lunch—which teachers were considered the hardest, which classes had the most prestige, how much Lakewood's college acceptance rates dominated everyone's thinking.

"Patterson for English is tough but worth it," he said, picking at his cafeteria sandwich. "Her recommendation letters are gold for college apps. Rodriguez for chemistry—same thing. If you can get an A in his class, colleges notice."

"How do you know all this?"

"My sister went here. She's at Yale now." He said it casually, like having a sister at Yale was completely normal. "She gave me the rundown when I started. Who to take classes with, which extracurriculars matter, how to navigate the social stuff."

I thought about my own family—my mother who'd never gone to college, my father who'd left when I was six. No one to give me the rundown on anything.

"Must be nice," I said before I could stop myself.

Cameron looked at me, something shifting in his expression. "Yeah. I guess it is."

Thursday, he showed me how to navigate the pay phone system. We stood in the student center hallway, and he demonstrated with his own calling card.

"You dial the 800 number first, then enter your PIN, then the number you're calling." He handed me a slip of paper with the phone company's information. "They sell cards at the bookstore—twenty dollars gets you about two hours of long-distance. More if you call evenings or weekends."

"Two hours doesn't seem like much."

"It's not. Most people call home once a week, keep it under thirty minutes." He pocketed his own card. "The school phone in your room is for local calls only. They monitor the bills and charge your account if you go over."

I did the math in my head—twenty dollars a month for phone cards, on top of everything else. Another expense my mother would have to cover.

Cameron must have seen something in my face because he added, "There are pay phones in town too. Sometimes they're cheaper if you're calling local Wisconsin numbers."

"My mom's in Milwaukee. That's long-distance."

"Right." He shifted his weight, awkward. "Well, the card system works. Just... budget the time."

We walked back toward the academic buildings in silence.

What surprised me most wasn't the information itself—I could have figured most of this out eventually. It was Cameron's patience. He never made me feel stupid for not knowing things that seemed obvious to everyone else. Never rolled his eyes or checked his watch like he had better places to be.

When I asked about the computer lab protocol—how to reserve time, which printers worked best, whether there were consequences for going over your two-hour session—he answered every question thoughtfully.

"The signup sheet is honor system," he explained, showing me the clipboard outside the lab. "You write your name and time slot. Most people respect it, but during midterms and finals, people will steal your spot if you're late. Show up five minutes early to be safe."

"And if someone takes my spot?"

"Find a staff member. They'll kick the person out." He grinned. "Lakewood takes rules seriously, even unofficial ones."

By Friday, we'd developed a rhythm. Coffee before first period, quick check-ins when we passed each other on campus, Cameron finding me at lunch to ask how my classes were going.

"How was the chemistry lab?" he asked, sliding into the seat across from me at the Whitman house table. A few other scholarship students glanced up, surprised to see Cameron Reid sitting with us.

"Intense. Rodriguez doesn't mess around."

"Told you. But you'll learn more in his class than anywhere else." Cameron stole a french fry from my plate. "What about Patterson? Started your first essay yet?"

"Due Monday. I'm terrified."

"Don't be. Just be specific. She hates vague generalizations." He grabbed another fry, completely comfortable despite the curious looks from my tablemates. "Cite textual evidence for everything. The more quotes, the better."

"Got it."

"And don't use a thesaurus to sound smart. She can tell, and she hates it."

I laughed despite myself. "Anything else?"

"Proofread twice. She's brutal about typos." He stood, checking that habitual watch. "Crew practice. But text me if you need another pair of eyes on the essay."

"I don't have your number."

"Right." He grabbed a napkin and scribbled down digits. "Room phone. Leave a message if I'm not there."

He left, and I sat there holding a napkin with Cameron Reid's phone number on it, trying to process what had just happened.

Rachel leaned over from two seats down. "He just gave you his number."

"For the essay."

"Still." She raised her eyebrows. "That's not normal mentoring behavior."

"He's being helpful."

"Uh-huh." Rachel went back to her sandwich, but I caught her skeptical expression.

Over the following days, Cameron told me about Lakewood traditions in the casual way you'd explain inside jokes to a new friend.

"Fall regatta is basically the whole school's obsession," he said during one of our coffee meetings. "It's the first big crew competition of the season. Everyone goes—students, faculty, alumni. We race against our biggest rival school. Winning matters."

"Because of school pride?"

"That, and bragging rights for the whole year." He smiled, and I saw genuine excitement there. "Plus college coaches come to watch. It's a big deal for recruiting."

"So you're nervous."

"Terrified," he admitted. "But also ready. We've been training since summer."

"I'll have to come watch."

"You should. It's actually pretty cool, even if you don't care about crew." He paused. "Which you probably don't."

"I don't know anything about it," I admitted. "But I'm willing to learn."

Something in his expression softened. "I'll explain it to you sometime. The basics, at least."

He told me about winter formal, spring traditions like senior prank day and the end-of-year carnival. He made Lakewood sound less intimidating, more like a place with personality than an institution designed to remind me I didn't belong.

"You make it sound fun," I said one morning.

"It can be. If you let it." Cameron looked at me over his coffee cup. "I know the social stuff is complicated. The class divisions and legacy politics and all that. But there are good parts too. You just have to find them."

"Like terrible coffee before first period?"

He laughed. "Exactly like that."

I found myself looking forward to these meetings in ways that probably weren't smart. Cameron made me laugh with his observations about campus personalities—the drama teacher who spoke exclusively in theatrical proclamations, the math teacher who wore the same sweater vest every Wednesday, the cafeteria worker who gave bigger portions if you complimented her cooking.

He asked about my classes and actually listened to my answers. Remembered details I'd mentioned days ago—that I was struggling with French conjugations, that I'd liked the book we were reading in English, that the third-floor bathroom in the science building had better water pressure than the others.

It felt like friendship.

Which was dangerous, because Rachel's warning still echoed: *You're a responsibility to him, not a person.*

But when Cameron showed up at my library carrel on Saturday afternoon, claiming he needed a quiet place to work on his college essay but choosing the desk next to mine instead of the dozens of other empty spaces, it was hard to remember that this was supposed to be just mentorship.

"How's the Patterson essay?" he asked, settling into his seat.

"Done. Proofread twice, quotes cited, no thesaurus."

"Look at you, following instructions." He grinned. "You're going to do fine here, Sophie."

The way he said my name—casual, friendly, like we'd known each other for years instead of weeks—made something warm bloom in my chest.

I buried my face in my textbook before he could see me smile.

That evening at dinner, I watched Cameron across the dining hall at the Morrison table. He was surrounded by his crew team friends, laughing at something Tyler said, perfectly at ease in his world. Vanessa sat two seats down, and even from a distance I could see how well she fit there—blonde and polished and exactly the kind of girl who belonged next to Cameron Reid.

"You're staring," Rachel said quietly.

I jerked my attention back to my own plate. "No, I'm not."

"Sophie." Rachel's voice was gentle but firm. "Don't do this to yourself."

"Do what?"

"Get attached. He's being nice because that's his job right now. In a few weeks, the mentoring period will end, and he'll go back to his life. You need to be okay with that."

"I know."

"Do you?" Rachel leaned closer. "Because you're looking at him like he's your friend. And maybe he is, right now. But Cameron Reid has a whole world here that doesn't include scholarship students. Don't forget that."

"I won't."

But as I walked back to Whitman Hall that night, I couldn't help wondering if Rachel was right. Was this friendship, or was I just the project Cameron had chosen for the semester? When the mentoring program officially ended, would he still show up for terrible coffee before first period? Would he still save me a seat at lunch, still help me with my essays, still make me laugh with his observations about campus life?

Or would I become just another line on his Princeton application—*helped first-year scholarship student adjust to Lakewood, demonstrated leadership and community service*—and nothing more?

I didn't know.

And I wasn't sure I wanted to find out.
