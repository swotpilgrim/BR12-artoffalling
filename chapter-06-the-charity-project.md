# Chapter 6: The Charity Project

"I don't think this is a good idea," Rachel said for the third time as we walked across campus Saturday evening.

"You're the one who said I need to try fitting in." I pulled my cardigan tighter against the October chill.

"I said focus on your grades. That's different from voluntarily walking into the lion's den."

The "lion's den" was a social gathering in Morrison Hall's common room—the kind of casual weekend party where people hung out, listened to music, and pretended they weren't all hyperaware of social hierarchies. Someone had posted a flyer in the student center, and I'd convinced Rachel we should at least make an appearance.

"We'll stay an hour," I promised. "If it's terrible, we'll leave."

"It's going to be terrible."

Morrison Hall was nicer than Whitman—newer furniture, better lighting, bigger common room with a television that actually got cable channels. When we arrived, about twenty students were already there, scattered across couches and floor cushions. Someone had brought a CD player, and music I vaguely recognized played in the background.

I spotted Cameron immediately. He was sitting on the arm of a couch, surrounded by guys I recognized from seeing them together at meals—crew team, probably. Vanessa Price sat on the couch next to him, looking perfect in a cashmere sweater and jeans that probably cost more than my entire wardrobe.

Cameron saw me and smiled, waving me over. "Sophie! You came."

Every eye in the vicinity turned to look at me. I felt Rachel tense beside me, but we crossed the room together.

"Hey," I said, trying to sound casual. "Hope it's okay we crashed."

"Of course. Everyone's welcome." Cameron stood, gesturing to his friends. "This is Tyler Brennan, Mike Chen, Jason Rodriguez. And you've met Vanessa."

"Hey," Tyler said, giving me a once-over that wasn't quite rude but wasn't exactly warm either. "You're Cameron's mentoring project, right?"

The word "project" hit like a slap. I tried to smile. "His mentee, yeah. I'm Sophie. This is my roommate, Rachel."

"Cool, cool." Tyler took a sip from his Coke can. "Always good to help the new kids adjust. Cameron's really committed to the program."

There was something in his tone—not malicious exactly, but patronizing. Like I was a puppy Cameron was training.

"We try to do our part," Vanessa added with a warm smile that didn't quite reach her eyes. "Community service is so important."

Community service. Like I was a volunteer opportunity.

Cameron seemed oblivious to the undercurrent. "Grab some seats. We were just talking about summer."

Rachel and I perched on the edge of the coffee table since all the good seats were taken. I tried to look comfortable while my jeans—bought at a thrift store in Milwaukee—felt suddenly, painfully obvious next to Vanessa's designer denim.

"So Tyler's family has this place in Door County," Mike was saying. "We went up for a week in August. Took the boats out every day."

"The sailing was incredible," Cameron said. "Perfect wind."

"My dad's talking about getting a new racing sloop," Tyler added. "The old one's fine, but if I'm going to crew in college, might as well practice on competitive equipment."

They were talking about sailboats—multiple sailboats—like it was completely normal. Like everyone's father just casually bought racing equipment that probably cost more than my mother's annual salary.

"Do you sail, Sophie?" Vanessa asked politely.

"No. I've never been on a sailboat."

"Oh." Vanessa blinked, like she couldn't quite process that. "Well, maybe you'll get to try it here. The school has a sailing team."

"I'm not really the sailing type."

"What did you do over the summer?" Tyler asked, and I couldn't tell if he was genuinely curious or making conversation because Cameron expected him to.

"Worked. At a grocery store." I said it plainly, daring them to react.

"Oh, that's..." Tyler searched for words. "Good. Work ethic. Colleges like that."

Like working wasn't something you did because you needed money. Like it was a character-building exercise I'd chosen for my resume.

Mike jumped in, trying to be helpful. "My cousin worked at a coffee shop last summer. Said it was actually pretty interesting, learning about business operations."

"Right," I managed. His cousin had probably worked for fun, for experience, not because his family needed the money.

The conversation moved on to other topics—someone's vacation in the Hamptons, someone else's internship at their father's law firm, a family trip to Europe. Each story was punctuated with casual references to money and privilege so ingrained they didn't even notice it.

Jason mentioned casually that his family's country club had renovated their pool. Tyler complained about how his summer lacrosse camp had conflicts with his family's trip to Martha's Vineyard. They talked about these things like minor inconveniences, not recognizing that each sentence highlighted a world I'd never touch.

I sat there, my thrift-store cardigan suddenly feeling thin and cheap, and tried to look engaged. Tried to smile at the right moments. Tried not to let my face show how every sentence was a reminder that I didn't belong here.

Rachel caught my eye from across the table, her expression saying *I told you so* without words.

"How are you liking Lakewood?" Vanessa asked me during a lull. She was trying, I realized. Actually making an effort to include me.

"It's good. Academically challenging."

"That's wonderful. Are you planning to join any clubs?" Her tone was friendly but distant, like she was interviewing me for a position.

"Maybe. Still getting oriented."

"Cameron's been helping you with that, I'm sure. He's so good at showing new students around." Vanessa smiled at Cameron with easy familiarity. "Remember when you mentored that sophomore last year? The one from Minnesota?"

"David. Yeah, he's doing well. Made varsity soccer."

"See? Cameron has a real gift for this." Vanessa turned back to me. "You're lucky to have him as your mentor."

Lucky. Like winning a prize.

Tyler launched into a story about their crew team practice, something about erg times and split records that I didn't understand. Cameron got pulled into the conversation, demonstrating some technique with his hands while the other guys argued about training methods.

I watched him laugh at something Tyler said, completely at ease with these people who spoke his language—legacy students with summer houses and family boats and internships at their fathers' firms. This was Cameron's world. These were his real friends, the people he'd chosen, not the scholarship student he'd been assigned.

"Want to get some air?" Rachel asked quietly.

I nodded, already standing.

We slipped toward the door, and I didn't think Cameron noticed. He was deep in conversation about the upcoming regatta, his face animated in ways I rarely saw during our coffee meetings. This was where he belonged—surrounded by people like him, people who understood the unspoken rules because they'd been born into them.

Outside, the October night was cold and clear. Stars scattered across the sky above Lakewood's dark campus.

"I told you," Rachel said, not unkindly.

"I know."

"You're his charity project, Sophie. His community service." Rachel pulled her jacket closer. "Don't forget that."

"I won't."

But even as I said it, I felt the sting of humiliation burning in my chest. Tyler's casual dismissal—*helping the new kids*—and Vanessa's polite distance—*community service is so important*—and Cameron's complete comfort in a world where I was always going to be the outsider.

I'd known it, theoretically. But knowing something and feeling it were different things.

Through Morrison Hall's windows, I could see the party continuing. Cameron was still on the couch, still laughing, still perfectly at home. He probably hadn't even noticed I'd left.

"Come on," Rachel said. "Let's go back to Whitman."

We walked across campus in silence. The paths were empty, most students either at the party or holed up in their rooms studying. Our footsteps echoed on the brick walkways.

"For what it's worth," Rachel said as we climbed Whitman's stairs, "Cameron seems like he actually cares. More than most of the legacy students who do mentoring."

"But at the end of the day, I'm still just his project."

"Yeah." Rachel unlocked our door. "You are."

I lay in bed that night, staring at the ceiling, replaying the evening. Tyler's patronizing tone. Vanessa's polite condescension. The casual conversation about wealth so enormous they didn't even see it as wealth—just normal life.

And Cameron, laughing with his friends, surrounded by people who actually belonged in his world.

I'd let myself forget, over the past few weeks, exactly what I was to him. The coffee meetings and helpful advice and genuine conversations had felt like friendship. But tonight had been a reminder: Cameron Reid moved through a world I would never be part of. He was being kind because that's what good people did—helped those less fortunate, mentored scholarship students, performed community service.

But I wasn't his friend. I was his project.

And pretending otherwise was only going to hurt more when the mentoring period ended and he went back to his real life—the one with sailboats and summer houses and girls like Vanessa who knew how to fit into his world without effort.

I rolled over, facing the wall, and tried to ignore the tight feeling in my throat.

Rachel was right. I needed to focus on my grades, my future, getting out. Everything else—especially the dangerous feeling that maybe Cameron saw me as more than a checkbox on his Princeton application—was just a distraction.

I'd remember that.

I had to.
