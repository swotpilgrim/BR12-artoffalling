# Chapter 11: Crossing Lines

The awkwardness from The Point faded over the next few days, but something had fundamentally changed. We both felt it—the awareness that hung between us, the careful distance we maintained that hadn't been necessary before.

But we also kept showing up for each other. Cameron still appeared at my library carrel. I still met him for terrible coffee before first period. We still found our way to The Point when we needed to escape campus scrutiny.

If anything, we spent more time together than ever.

"Is that Cameron Reid?" Maria whispered one day at lunch, watching Cameron cross the dining hall toward the Whitman table with his tray.

"Yeah," I said, trying to sound casual.

"He's coming over here?"

Cameron settled into the seat across from me like it was completely normal. Which, for us, it had become. But the other scholarship students at the table stared.

"Hey," he said, stealing a french fry from my plate. "How'd the Patterson essay go?"

"Got it back this morning. B-plus."

"Nice. She's tough. B-plus is solid."

"She said my thesis needed work but my textual analysis was strong."

"See? Told you that you were good at close reading."

We fell into easy conversation about the essay, about his upcoming debate tournament, about the chemistry exam we both had next week. Around us, I could feel the other students watching—curious, confused, maybe a little judgmental.

Across the dining hall at the Morrison table, Tyler was watching too. When Cameron laughed at something I said, Tyler leaned over to the guy next to him and said something I couldn't hear. They both looked our way.

Cameron noticed. His jaw tightened slightly, but he didn't look away from me.

"Ignore them," I said quietly.

"I am." But his voice had an edge.

After lunch, as we walked toward the academic buildings together, James fell into step beside us.

"Sophie, can I talk to you for a second?"

Cameron glanced at me. I nodded, and he continued ahead toward his next class.

"What's going on with you and Reid?" James asked once Cameron was out of earshot.

"We're friends."

"Friends." James sounded skeptical. "Sophie, people are talking. You're spending a lot of time with him. Sitting together at lunch, meeting after classes, disappearing together in the evenings."

"So?"

"So he's not your people. He's legacy, scholarship students are—"

"I know what I am," I cut him off. "I don't need a reminder."

"I'm not trying to be a jerk. I'm trying to look out for you." James's expression was concerned, not mean. "Cameron Reid is in a different world. When he's done with whatever this is—mentoring, friendship, whatever—he's going back to that world. And you're going to get hurt."

"Why does everyone assume that?"

"Because that's how it works here. Legacy students don't actually befriend scholarship students. They help us out, they're polite, they do their community service. But we're not actually their friends."

"Cameron's different."

"Maybe." James didn't sound convinced. "Just be careful, okay? I don't want to see you get hurt when reality sets in."

He headed to class, leaving me standing in the hallway trying not to feel defensive.

But James was wrong. Cameron wasn't performing friendship. What we had was real.

Wasn't it?

That evening at The Point, the temperature had dropped enough that I could see my breath. I'd worn my warmest jacket, but the cold still seeped through.

Cameron arrived a few minutes after me, appearing on the path with his crew jacket and a second sweatshirt in his hands.

"I thought you might be cold," he said, handing me the sweatshirt.

"Thanks." I pulled it on over my jacket. It smelled like him—laundry detergent and something woodsy that I'd started to associate with comfort.

We sat on our bench, watching the last rays of sunlight fade across the lake. The water had turned dark and choppy with the cold, small waves slapping against the rocks below.

"Tyler cornered me after practice," Cameron said after a while. "Wanted to know why I keep ditching guys' night for library sessions with you."

"What did you say?"

"That you're my friend and I like spending time with you." Cameron picked up a stone, turning it over in his hands. "He didn't get it. Asked why I'd choose hanging out with a scholarship student over my actual friends. Like those two things are mutually exclusive."

The casual cruelty of it—*a scholarship student*, like that was my defining characteristic—made my chest tight.

"I'm sorry," I said.

"For what?"

"For making your life complicated. For being the reason Tyler questions your priorities. For..." I gestured vaguely. "All of it."

"Sophie." Cameron set down the stone and turned to face me. "You're not making my life complicated. You're making it better. Tyler can think whatever he wants. I don't care."

"You should. He's your friend."

"You're my friend too. A better one, honestly. Tyler's known me for three years and he still sees me as Cameron Reid, crew captain, Princeton legacy. You actually see me as just Cameron. That matters more than Tyler's approval."

The intensity in his voice made my heart race.

"I'm cold," I admitted, changing the subject because his words felt too significant to address directly.

"Here." Cameron shifted closer, positioning himself as a windbreak. "Better?"

It was better. And also infinitely more complicated. Because now we were sitting pressed together—his shoulder against mine, his warmth seeping through our layers of clothes, the scent of his cologne mixing with the cold air.

"You're shivering," he observed.

Before I could respond, Cameron shrugged out of his crew jacket and draped it over my shoulders on top of the sweatshirt I was already wearing. His hands lingered for just a moment, adjusting the collar.

When I looked up to thank him, our faces were suddenly very close. Close enough that I could see the darker flecks in his eyes, the slight stubble on his jaw, the way his breath caught when he realized the proximity.

His eyes dropped to my mouth for just a second before returning to meet my gaze.

The moment stretched between us—loaded, electric, terrifying. All I had to do was lean forward a few inches. Close the gap that had been growing smaller for weeks.

Cameron's hand moved slightly, like he might touch my face. My heart was pounding so hard I could hear it in my ears.

"Sophie," he said, and his voice was rough. "I—"

A burst of laughter from the path behind us shattered the moment. A group of students walked past, heading back to campus, their voices loud in the quiet evening.

We both pulled back quickly. Cameron stood, shoving his hands in his pockets. I wrapped his jacket tighter around myself, suddenly cold despite all the layers.

"We should get back," Cameron said, not quite meeting my eyes. "It's getting dark."

"Right. Yeah."

We walked back to campus in silence—not comfortable this time, but charged with everything we hadn't said, hadn't done, hadn't acknowledged.

At the edge of campus where we usually parted ways, Cameron stopped.

"Sophie—"

"I should go," I interrupted, afraid of what he might say. Afraid of what I might say if he did. "Rachel's probably wondering where I am."

"Okay." Cameron looked like he wanted to say more, but didn't. "See you tomorrow?"

"Yeah. Tomorrow."

I practically fled to Whitman Hall.

Rachel took one look at my face when I entered our room and set down her book.

"Okay. We need to talk."

"I'm fine."

"You're wearing Cameron Reid's jacket. And his sweatshirt. And you look like you just ran away from something." Rachel patted her bed. "Sit. Talk."

I sat, pulling my knees to my chest.

"Do you have feelings for him?" Rachel asked directly.

"I don't—" I started to deflect, then stopped. "I don't know."

"Sophie."

"Okay, yes. Maybe. Probably." I buried my face in my hands. "This is such a bad idea."

"Yeah, it is." Rachel's voice was gentle. "But that's not really the question. The question is what are you going to do about it?"

"Nothing. I'm going to do nothing. Because even if I do have feelings for him—which I'm not saying I do—there's no way Cameron feels the same way. He's just being nice. He's my friend. That's all."

Rachel gave me a look that suggested she knew better but wasn't going to argue.

"And even if he did feel something," I continued, mostly trying to convince myself, "it wouldn't work. We're from completely different worlds. Tyler and his friends already judge him for spending time with me. Can you imagine what they'd say if we were actually... if we were..."

"Dating?" Rachel supplied.

Just saying the word made my stomach flip.

"It's not going to happen," I said firmly. "Cameron's going to Princeton. He's going to row for some elite college team. He's going to marry someone like Vanessa who knows which fork to use and has a summer house and fits perfectly into his world. Not someone like me."

"You don't know that."

"Yes, I do." I stood, peeling off Cameron's jacket and sweatshirt. "And it's fine. We're friends. That's enough."

"Is it?"

I didn't answer. Couldn't answer. Because the truth was that friendship had stopped being enough somewhere along the way. Maybe weeks ago. Maybe tonight when his eyes dropped to my mouth and my entire body had responded with want.

But wanting something and being able to have it were very different things.

And Cameron Reid—Princeton legacy, crew captain, golden boy of Lakewood Academy—was firmly in the category of things I could want but never have.

I needed to remember that.

Before I got hurt.

Before this thing between us that I couldn't quite name turned into something I couldn't recover from.

I lay in bed that night replaying the moment at The Point. The way Cameron had looked at me. The almost-touch of his hand near my face. The rough edge to his voice when he'd said my name.

He'd felt it too. I was almost certain.

But almost certain wasn't the same as sure.

And with someone like Cameron Reid, I needed to be sure.

Because I was already in deeper than was safe.

And if I was wrong about what I'd seen in his eyes tonight, the fall was going to hurt more than I could handle.
