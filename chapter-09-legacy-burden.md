# Chapter 9: Legacy Burden

Over the following week, I noticed Cameron seemed different.

It was subtle—the way he'd drift during our coffee meetings, his answers slightly delayed like he was pulling himself back from somewhere else. The way he'd check his phone more often, frowning at messages I couldn't see. The slight tension in his shoulders that hadn't been there before.

"You okay?" I asked on Thursday morning, watching him stare into his coffee cup like it held answers.

"Yeah. Fine." He looked up with a quick smile that didn't quite reach his eyes. "Just tired. Crew practice has been intense."

I didn't push. We'd only just started really talking—real conversations, not just surface mentoring stuff. I wasn't sure I had the right to ask for more.

But by Friday afternoon, when Cameron suggested we meet at The Point instead of the library, I knew something was actually wrong.

The November air was cold enough that I could see my breath as I walked the path through the woods. The trees were mostly bare now, their leaves carpeting the ground in shades of rust and gold. When I reached the outcropping, Cameron was already there, sitting on our bench staring out at the grey water.

"Hey," I said, settling beside him.

"Hey." He didn't look at me, just kept watching the lake. Small waves lapped at the rocks below, the sound rhythmic and somehow sad.

I waited. I'd learned that about Cameron—sometimes he needed space to gather his thoughts before speaking.

Finally, he said, "My dad called last night."

"About Princeton?"

"About everything. Princeton. Crew. Grades. Whether I'm setting myself up for success." He said the last part with bitter emphasis, like quoting something he'd heard too many times. "He wanted to know if I'd finished my application essays yet."

"Have you?"

"I rewrote the main one. The one you said sounded performative." Cameron picked up a small stone, turning it over in his hands. "Tried to make it more honest, like you suggested. More about the pressure and expectations and trying to figure out who I actually am versus who everyone expects me to be."

"That sounds good."

"He hated it." Cameron's laugh was harsh. "Said it made me sound weak. Uncertain. Princeton doesn't want doubt, Sophie. They want confidence. Leadership. They want someone who knows exactly who they are and where they're going."

"But that's not realistic. Nobody our age has it all figured out."

"Maybe not. But I'm supposed to." He threw the stone toward the water. It disappeared with a small splash. "I'm a Reid. Fourth generation Lakewood, third generation Princeton. My grandfather donated a library. My father was valedictorian. My sister's at Yale on track for law school. I'm supposed to know exactly who I am—I'm a Reid. That's supposed to be enough."

There was so much pain in his voice that I didn't know what to say.

"He's already talking about which eating clubs I should rush," Cameron continued. "Which professors to take classes with, which internships to line up, how to position myself for business school or law school or whatever comes after. Like Princeton is already a done deal. Like I've already accomplished everything I need to accomplish."

"What if you don't get in?"

"That's not an option." He said it flatly. "Reids go to Princeton. It's tradition. It's legacy. It's expected."

"But what if you didn't want to go? What if you wanted something different?"

Cameron finally looked at me, and his expression was raw. "Then I'd be disappointing everyone who's ever believed in me. My father. My grandfather. The school. Everyone who sees the Reid name and expects certain things."

"That's a lot of pressure."

"Yeah." He leaned back against the bench, tilting his head up toward the grey sky. "And the worst part? I'm terrified I'm not actually good enough. That I'm only special because of my last name. That without the legacy connections and the donated library and the family history, I'm just... average."

My chest ached at the vulnerability in his voice. "Cameron, you're not average."

"How do you know? How does anyone know?" He gestured toward campus behind us. "Everything I've achieved here—crew captain, debate team, academics—how much of that is actually me, and how much is just people treating me better because I'm a Reid? How many opportunities did I get because someone knew my father, or my grandfather, or saw my name on a roster and decided to give me a chance?"

I thought about how different that was from my own experience—having to work twice as hard for half the recognition, knowing that my scholarship status meant some people would never see past "charity case."

"At least people give you chances," I said quietly.

"I know. I know that sounds privileged and ungrateful." Cameron ran his hands through his hair. "I have opportunities you don't. I'm not denying that. But I'm also constantly wondering if I've earned anything on my own merit, or if it's all just legacy and connections and name recognition."

"That's not the same as being average."

"Isn't it? If you take away the name, the connections, the family history—what's left? Am I actually good at crew, or do I just have access to better coaching? Am I actually smart, or do I just have parents who could afford SAT prep and private tutors? Do my teachers think I'm capable, or do they just see my last name on papers and grade accordingly?"

I'd never thought about it that way. I'd spent so much time feeling like I had to prove I deserved to be at Lakewood that I'd never considered that Cameron might feel the same way for completely opposite reasons.

"I think you're smart," I said. "And good at crew. And a good leader. I've seen you with people—you make them feel comfortable, included. That's not about your last name. That's just you."

Cameron looked at me, something vulnerable and hopeful in his expression. "You think so?"

"I know so." I shifted on the bench to face him more directly. "When you helped me navigate Lakewood, you didn't just hand me information and disappear. You actually cared whether I understood. Whether I felt comfortable. You still check in, even though the mentoring program doesn't require it anymore. That's not legacy. That's who you are."

"Or maybe I'm just good at performing kindness. Maybe that's another thing Reids are supposed to be good at—noblesse oblige, community service, helping the less fortunate." He said it bitterly, but I heard the question underneath: *Am I genuine, or am I just well-trained?*

"You're not performing with me." I said it with certainty. "Not anymore. Maybe you were at first, but not now. The conversations we have, the stuff you've told me—that's real. I can tell the difference."

"Can you?"

"Yes." I thought about the past weeks—the coffee meetings, the library study sessions, the way Cameron had listened at The Point when I talked about feeling out of place. "When you're with Tyler and those guys, you're different. You're playing a role—the confident legacy student, the crew captain, the guy with all the answers. But with me, you're just... Cameron. The person under all that expectation."

He was quiet for a long moment, processing. When he spoke again, his voice was softer.

"My father wants me to break up with—" He stopped, corrected himself. "He doesn't think I should spend so much time with scholarship students. Says it looks like I'm avoiding my own social circle. That it sends the wrong message about where my priorities are."

The words stung, but I tried not to show it. "What did you say?"

"That who I spend time with is my business." Cameron met my eyes. "That you're my friend, and I'm not going to stop being your friend because someone thinks I should only associate with people from the right families."

My throat felt tight. "You said that?"

"Yeah." He smiled slightly. "He wasn't happy. But I meant it, Sophie. You're the first person in a long time who's actually seen me as just Cameron. Not Cameron Reid, legacy student. Not the crew captain with Princeton expectations. Just me. That matters more than whatever social messaging my father is worried about."

I didn't know what to say. We sat there in silence, and I realized how similar our fears actually were. I was afraid of being seen as nothing but the scholarship girl—the charity project, the diversity statistics, never quite good enough or genuinely belonging. Cameron was afraid of being seen as nothing but his legacy—the family name, the inherited privilege, never quite sure what he'd earned on his own merit.

Both of us felt like frauds in different ways. Both of us carried the weight of other people's expectations and sacrifices. Both of us wondered if we'd ever be enough, just as ourselves.

"We're kind of a mess," I said finally.

Cameron laughed, genuine this time. "Yeah. We really are."

"But at least we're a mess together?"

"At least there's that." He bumped his shoulder against mine gently. "Thanks for listening. And for being honest about the essay. Even if my father hated it, you were right. I needed to write something real."

"You'll figure it out. The essay, Princeton, all of it."

"And you'll figure out your stuff too. Belonging here, college applications, convincing yourself you deserve all this."

"We'll both figure it out eventually."

"Eventually," Cameron agreed.

The sun was setting earlier these days, and already the light was starting to fade. We should probably head back before it got completely dark. But neither of us moved.

"Same time tomorrow?" Cameron asked. "Library study session? I have that chemistry exam next week."

"I could use the study time too."

"Good." He stood, offering me his hand to help me up. When I took it, his grip was warm and steady.

We walked back toward campus together, our breath visible in the cold air. The conversation had shifted something between us again—another layer of understanding, another level of trust.

Cameron wasn't just the golden boy I'd assumed when we met. He was someone struggling under impossible expectations, questioning his own worth, trying to figure out who he actually was beneath all the pressure and legacy.

And I wasn't just the scholarship girl grateful for help. I was someone he actually valued, actually listened to, actually cared about.

Maybe Rachel was wrong. Maybe this wasn't just mentorship that would end when applications were submitted.

Maybe this was real friendship.

Or maybe—and this thought made my heart race in ways I wasn't ready to examine—maybe it was becoming something more.
