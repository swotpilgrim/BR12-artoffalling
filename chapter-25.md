# Chapter 25: The Race Begins

The starter's flag hung in the air for one eternal second, red fabric bright against the gray November sky. The entire lakeshore held its breath—hundreds of students, faculty, alumni, all focused on that single point of color that would signal the beginning.

Then it dropped.

The boats exploded forward in perfect unison, oars hitting water with a sound like thunder. Four crews, thirty-two rowers, all pulling with maximum force from the very first stroke. The noise was immediate and overwhelming—the crowd roaring, Coach Anderson shouting encouragement through his megaphone, the rhythmic splash of oars cutting through water.

I'd never watched a crew race before. Didn't understand the technical details or strategic elements—didn't know what split times meant or how to read the stroke rate or what constituted good form versus struggling technique. But even I could feel the raw power as those boats surged away from the starting line, eight rowers moving as one organism in each shell, the water churning white in their wake. The shells themselves were impossibly narrow, looking like they might tip over at any moment, yet somehow staying perfectly balanced even as the rowers threw their full weight into each stroke.

Cameron sat at stroke seat in Lakewood's boat, his back to me, shoulders and arms working in powerful, rhythmic pulls. He set the pace for the entire crew—when he pulled, they all pulled. When he accelerated, they accelerated. His rhythm was their rhythm, his pain their pain, his determination their determination. Everything depended on him maintaining perfect form, perfect timing, perfect focus despite exhaustion and pressure and the weight of four generations of Reid family expectations.

"They're even with Hadley," Rachel said beside me, her voice tense with excitement.

I didn't know which boat was Hadley, but I could see that Lakewood was neck-and-neck with one of the other crews. Two boats pulling away slightly from the other two, fighting for the early lead.

The announcer's voice crackled over the loudspeaker: "And we're off! Lakewood Academy and Hadley Prep taking the early lead, separated by less than a boat length. St. Joseph's and Riverside in pursuit..."

Around me, students screamed encouragement. Some had painted their faces blue and gold, Lakewood's colors. Others waved handmade banners. The energy was electric, infectious, the kind of collective excitement that came from a community united behind a single cause.

But I couldn't join in the celebration. Could only watch Cameron's back, watch the powerful pull of his oars, watch for any sign that the week's tension was affecting his performance.

"Come on, Lakewood!" someone shouted near me.

"Let's go! Maintain that pace!"

"Five-hundred meters in," the announcer called. "Lakewood and Hadley still even. This is shaping up to be a race for the ages, folks. Neither crew giving an inch."

I wrapped my arms around myself, cold despite my jacket. The race was two thousand meters total—about six and a half minutes of all-out physical effort. They were a quarter of the way through, and already I could see the strain in Cameron's body, the way every muscle worked to maintain that punishing pace.

"They're doing good," Rachel said, but I heard the uncertainty under her encouragement. "Right? They look good?"

"I don't know," I admitted. "I can't tell."

What I could tell was that this was brutal. That every stroke required enormous effort. That Cameron was pouring everything into this race—all the training, all the discipline, all the pressure of family legacy and team expectations and five-year winning streaks.

And that if they lost, people would say it was because of me.

The boats were farther out on the lake now, harder to see in detail. But I could still make out Lakewood's distinctive blue and gold, could still track Cameron's position at stroke seat, could still see the synchronization—or lack thereof—in the crew's movements.

They looked slightly off. Nothing dramatic, nothing obvious to the casual observer. But there was a fraction of a second delay in some rowers' catches, a minor variation in their rhythm. The boat that should have moved like a single organism looked like eight individuals trying desperately to work together.

"One thousand meters!" the announcer called. "Halfway point! Hadley Prep has edged ahead by half a boat length. Lakewood fighting to maintain contact..."

The crowd around me groaned. I heard someone behind me mutter, "They're losing it. What's wrong with them?"

"Too much drama this week," another voice responded. "Can't focus with all that relationship garbage distracting the captain."

My face burned. I wanted to turn around and defend Cameron, defend us, explain that he was still giving everything he had. But Rachel's hand on my arm stopped me.

"Ignore them," she said firmly. "Just watch the race."

On the water, I could see Lakewood responding to being behind. The stroke rate increased—Cameron pulling faster, demanding more from his exhausted crew. The other seven rowers matched his pace, and the boat surged forward in a desperate bid to close the gap.

"Power ten!" Coach Anderson's voice carried across the water, audible even over the crowd noise. "Give me ten strokes at maximum power!"

It was a standard racing call—ten all-out strokes to make a push. I watched Cameron's back, saw him driving even harder, saw the entire boat respond with brutal effort.

For those ten strokes, Lakewood moved like the championship crew they were supposed to be. Perfect synchronization. Perfect power. Perfect aggression. The boat leaped forward, eating up the distance between them and Hadley.

"That's it!" someone screamed near me. "That's what we need!"

"They're coming back! Look at them go!"

The crowd was on its feet now, everyone screaming encouragement. I found myself holding my breath, willing Cameron forward, willing the crew to maintain that perfect form, willing them to somehow overcome the week's tension and row the race they were capable of rowing.

"Thirteen hundred meters," the announcer called. "And Lakewood has pulled even with Hadley! We are dead even, ladies and gentlemen. This is anyone's race!"

My heart pounded. The boats were so far out now that I could barely see individual rowers, just the general shapes of the shells slicing through water. But I knew Cameron was out there, pouring everything he had into those oar strokes, refusing to give up despite exhaustion and team tension and all the complications I'd brought into his life.

"Seven hundred meters remaining!" The announcer's voice was getting more excited. "Both crews digging deep. The pain cave is real, folks, and these athletes are living in it!"

Rachel grabbed my hand and squeezed. Around us, the crowd had reached a fever pitch of noise. Everyone was on their feet, screaming, willing their team forward. The alumni near the boathouse looked tense and focused, reliving their own racing memories. Faculty were leaning forward, caught up in the drama despite themselves.

And I just stood there, holding Rachel's hand, watching Cameron race, knowing that in a few minutes this would be over and we'd know—would they win or lose? Would the week's drama cost them everything? Would choosing me have been worth it?

The not-knowing was agony. The watching from shore while Cameron poured everything into those oar strokes, while his body screamed with exhaustion, while the outcome hung in perfect balance. I wanted to do something, help somehow, take away some of the burden he was carrying. But all I could do was stand here and watch and hope.

"Six hundred meters!" the announcer shouted. "Still dead even! Neither crew giving up! This is what championship racing looks like!"

The boats were close enough now that I could see individual rowers again. Could see Cameron's back, still driving that relentless pace despite what had to be unbearable pain. Could see the water churning violently. Could see both crews refusing to break, refusing to let the other pull ahead, both willing to suffer as long as it took to win. The boats looked like they were barely moving now, each stroke gaining only inches, the exhaustion visible even from shore in the desperate, grinding effort.

"Come on, Cameron," I whispered, knowing he couldn't possibly hear me but needing to say it anyway. "Come on."

The race was entering its final phase. Five hundred meters left. Less than two minutes of rowing. Two minutes that would determine whether a five-year winning streak continued or ended. Whether Cameron's choice to go public with our relationship had cost him and his team everything.

Two minutes that felt like an eternity.

I watched those boats slice through the water, watched Cameron pour everything into each stroke, watched a race that was too close to call with the finish line approaching fast.

And all I could do was stand there and hope. Hope they'd win. Hope all the pain and judgment and complication had been worth it. Hope that choosing love over convenience would somehow, impossibly, work out.

The boats drove forward. The crowd screamed. The finish line waited.

And the race rushed toward its conclusion with a speed that felt both too fast and agonizingly slow.
