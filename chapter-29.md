# Chapter 29: The Point

At The Point, the celebration sounds faded to a distant murmur. Just us and the weathered bench and the lake stretching out before us, painted in the golden light of late afternoon. The November air was cold, but Cameron pulled me close, sharing warmth.

For a long moment, we just sat there in silence. Not the uncomfortable kind that needed filling, but the peaceful kind that came from being with someone who understood you.

"I almost didn't come today," I said finally.

Cameron pulled back enough to look at me. "To the regatta?"

"Yeah." I stared out at the water. "I was terrified. Of the stares, the whispers, all the judgment I knew I'd face. Rachel had to basically drag me out of our dorm room."

"I'm glad she did." Cameron's voice was soft. "Seeing you there, knowing you showed up despite being scared—that meant everything."

"I'm sorry my world has made things so hard for you," Cameron continued. "The social pressure, the legacy expectations, my parents' uncertainty. You shouldn't have to deal with all that just to be with me."

"It's not about your world versus mine anymore," I said, turning to face him. "It's about us choosing to be together despite all the complicated reality. The class differences and social barriers didn't go away just because we went public. But we're choosing each other anyway."

"Yeah," Cameron agreed. "We are."

He was quiet for a moment, looking out at the lake. "I spent my whole life being who everyone expected me to be. The perfect Reid son. The ideal legacy student. The crew captain who maintained tradition. I got so good at performing that role that I forgot there could be anything else."

"And now?" I asked gently.

"Now I know there's a difference between being perfect and being real." He looked at me, eyes serious. "You made me want to stop performing. Made me realize that being myself—messy and uncertain and sometimes failing to meet expectations—is better than being the perfect version everyone wants."

I leaned my head against his shoulder. "You made me believe I was worth more than just being grateful for scraps of acceptance. That I deserved to be chosen, not as someone's charity project but as an actual equal partner."

"You are my equal partner," Cameron said firmly. "In every way that matters."

We sat with that for a while, watching the light change on the water. The sun was getting lower, the golden hour approaching. In a few weeks, it would be too cold to sit out here like this. Winter would arrive, and with it a whole new set of challenges.

"What happens next?" I asked. "I mean, you're a senior. You're applying to colleges. Come spring, you'll graduate and I'll still have another year here."

Cameron exhaled slowly. "I don't know. I wish I had a better answer, but I honestly don't know how it works when I graduate and you're still here."

"Princeton?" I asked, even though I dreaded the answer. Princeton was hundreds of miles away. Princeton was his family's legacy school, the expected path.

"I'm still applying," Cameron admitted. "Because it's expected, and because I'm not brave enough to completely abandon every expectation all at once. But—" He paused. "I'm not sure it's what I actually want anymore."

"What do you want?"

"I want to figure out who I am separate from my family's legacy." Cameron's voice was thoughtful. "I want to choose my own path instead of following the prescribed one. And I want—" He squeezed my hand. "I want to figure out how to make this work with you, whatever that looks like."

"We have time," I said, trying to convince myself as much as him. "You don't have to make all those decisions right now."

"Neither do you," Cameron pointed out. "You're thinking about college applications too. Where you want to go, what you want to study. Don't limit your choices because of me."

"I won't if you won't," I said.

He smiled. "Deal."

The truth was, neither of us knew what the future held. Whether we'd survive him graduating, whether we'd make it through college applications and decisions, whether what we had was strong enough to withstand distance and time and all the practical complications that would come. Long-distance relationships were hard. Freshman year of college was transformative. So many things could change, could pull us apart, could make this love we'd fought for feel impossible to maintain.

But sitting there at The Point, Cameron's arm around me and the sun painting the water gold, I realized that was okay. Not knowing was okay. The uncertainty wasn't something to fear but something to face together. We'd been brave enough to choose each other publicly despite all the obstacles. We could be brave enough to navigate whatever came next.

Because we'd agreed to figure it out together. And that agreement—that commitment to face uncertainty as a team—mattered more than having all the answers right now.

"Thank you," Cameron said suddenly.

"For what?"

"For being brave enough to show up today. For demanding I choose you publicly instead of accepting being my secret. For walking away when I was too afraid to commit, because that's what made me realize I was about to lose the most important thing in my life." He kissed the top of my head. "You helped me be brave, Sophie. You helped me learn that some things are worth fighting for."

"You helped me be brave too," I said. "You made me believe I deserved to be chosen. That I could exist in spaces I'd been taught weren't for people like me. That being vulnerable wasn't weakness."

We'd both been falling, I realized. Falling away from the safe, prescribed paths we'd been on. Cameron falling away from legacy expectations and performing perfection. Me falling away from the defensive walls I'd built and the belief that I wasn't good enough for people like him.

And we'd caught each other in the fall.

That's what this whole thing had been about. Not staying perfectly balanced on some impossible tightrope between our different worlds. Not trying to maintain control while navigating incompatible social circles. But being willing to fall, trusting someone to catch you, choosing vulnerability over the safety of staying in your prescribed place.

The art of falling, I thought. That's what love was. That's what we'd learned together. Not maintaining perfect balance but being brave enough to lose your footing, to let yourself be vulnerable, to trust that the person you were falling toward would be there to catch you. To risk everything for the chance at something real.

And if they fell too, you'd catch each other. Hold each other up. Find your balance together instead of trying to maintain it alone. That was the secret—not avoiding the fall, but falling together. Not staying safe and separate, but being brave enough to trust someone completely.

It was terrifying. It was beautiful. It was worth it.

"What are you thinking about?" Cameron asked, noticing my silence.

"Just that falling isn't as scary when you're not doing it alone," I said.

He smiled, understanding immediately. "No. It's not."

The sun touched the horizon, painting the entire lake in shades of orange and pink and gold. The kind of sunset that made you stop and stare, that reminded you the world could be beautiful even when it was complicated.

"We should probably get back," Cameron said reluctantly. "Before it gets too dark to see the path."

"Probably," I agreed, not moving.

Neither of us wanted to leave this moment. This peaceful space where it was just us, no expectations or judgments or complications. Just two people who'd chosen each other despite all the reasons it would have been easier not to.

But eventually, we did get up. Started walking back toward campus, hand in hand, taking our time. The path through the woods was familiar now, worn smooth by all the times we'd walked it over the past few months.

"Hey, Sophie?" Cameron stopped just before we reached the edge of the woods.

"Yeah?"

"I love you." He said it simply, certainly, like it was the most obvious fact in the world. "I know I said it earlier in front of everyone, but I wanted to say it again. Here. Where it's just us."

My heart swelled. "I love you too."

We kissed there at the edge of the woods, private and unhurried, no audience to perform for. Just us and the fading light and the choice we'd both made to be brave enough to fall.

When we finally made it back to campus, the celebration was winding down. Students heading back to dorms, faculty saying their goodbyes, the lawn outside the boathouse emptying as the temperature dropped.

But Cameron still held my hand as we walked across the quad. Still kept me close as we said goodbye to lingering teammates and friends. Still claimed me publicly, proudly, without hesitation.

And when we finally parted ways—him heading to his dorm, me to mine—I walked back to Whitman Hall with a lightness I hadn't felt in weeks.

We'd done it. Gone public, faced the judgment, survived the scrutiny. Cameron had won his race despite all the drama. We'd met his parents and survived. We'd navigated the celebration and made it through.

Tomorrow would bring new challenges. Next week, next month, next semester—all of it uncertain. But we'd face it together, two people who'd learned that falling wasn't failure.

It was trust. Vulnerability. Choice.

It was love.
