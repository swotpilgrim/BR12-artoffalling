# Chapter 13: Vanessa's Observation

I was alone in the library on Thursday afternoon, trying to focus on my French homework, when Vanessa Price appeared at my study carrel.

"Sophie? Do you have a minute?"

I looked up, surprised. Vanessa and I had barely spoken since that initial introduction weeks ago. She stood there in a perfect cashmere sweater and pearls, looking like she'd stepped out of a catalog, while I wore my thrift-store cardigan and Target jeans.

"Um, sure." I closed my textbook, bracing for whatever this was. Confrontation about Cameron, probably. A polite suggestion that I stay in my lane.

Vanessa settled into the chair across from me, graceful even in the cramped library space. "I wanted to talk to you about Cameron."

Here it comes, I thought. The ex-girlfriend telling me to back off.

"Okay," I said carefully.

"I've noticed how he is around you." Vanessa's voice was direct but not unkind. "How he looks at you. The way his whole face changes when you walk into a room."

My heart started pounding. "I don't know what you—"

"Please don't pretend you haven't noticed." Vanessa gave me a small smile. "I dated Cameron for eight months. I know what he looks like when he's just being polite versus when he actually cares about someone. And Sophie, the way he looks at you? That's not politeness."

I couldn't breathe properly. Couldn't think of what to say.

"Cameron and I were together last year," Vanessa continued. "We made sense on paper—same social circle, same background, our families have summered together for years. It was comfortable. Easy. Everyone approved."

"Why are you telling me this?"

"Because I want you to understand that what we had was fine, but it was never... real. Not the way it should be." Vanessa's expression was thoughtful, not bitter. "We dated because it was expected. Because we fit together in all the ways that look good in photos and college applications. But we never actually connected. Not really."

I waited, not sure where she was going with this.

"We broke up mutually over the summer," Vanessa said. "We realized we were together out of convenience, not actual feeling. It was the right decision for both of us."

"That must have been hard."

"It was a relief, honestly." Vanessa smiled slightly. "Being with Cameron was like playing a role. We were performing this perfect relationship for everyone around us. But when it was just the two of us, we didn't have much to say to each other."

"Then why—"

"Because that's what was expected. Cameron Reid and Vanessa Price made sense. Legacy students from the right families doing the right things." She leaned forward slightly. "But Sophie, I've seen him with you. And it's completely different."

My mouth felt dry. "Different how?"

"He's himself with you. Actually himself, not the performance he puts on for everyone else." Vanessa's eyes were kind. "I've known Cameron for three years, and I've never seen him as relaxed and genuine as he is when he's talking to you. He laughs differently. Listens differently. He's not trying to be Cameron Reid, legacy student. He's just Cameron."

"We're just friends."

"Are you?" Vanessa asked gently. "Because from where I'm sitting, Cameron has feelings for you. Real ones. And I think you know that."

I wanted to deny it, but the words stuck in my throat. Because she was right—I had noticed. The way Cameron looked at me sometimes. The almost-touches. The charged silences. The moment at The Point when we'd nearly kissed.

I'd been telling myself I was imagining it. That someone like Cameron Reid couldn't actually have romantic feelings for someone like me. That I was reading too much into his kindness.

But Vanessa knew him. Had dated him. Could see the difference.

"I don't understand," I said finally. "Why are you telling me this? Aren't you—I mean, don't you want him back?"

"No." Vanessa said it simply. "Cameron and I are better as friends. We always were. And honestly, I'm happy for him. He deserves to be with someone who makes him this happy."

"I don't make him happy. I'm just—"

"Sophie." Vanessa's voice was firm. "Yes, you do. I've seen him at crew practice, at meals, around campus. He's different this semester. Lighter. More present. Tyler noticed it too, though he's less supportive about it than I am."

"Tyler thinks I'm a distraction."

"Tyler thinks anyone who isn't obsessed with crew is a distraction." Vanessa waved that away. "But the point is, Cameron is happier. And that happiness comes from you."

The words settled over me like a weight. Cameron was happy because of me. Cameron had feelings for me. Cameron looked at me differently than he'd looked at Vanessa—his perfect, appropriate ex-girlfriend.

"I need to be honest with you though," Vanessa continued, her expression turning more serious. "If you and Cameron become... more than friends, it's going to be difficult. Really difficult."

"I know. The social differences—"

"It's not just that. People are going to judge. They're going to assume you're using him, that you're after his money or his connections. They're going to make both your lives harder." Vanessa's eyes were sympathetic. "Legacy students dating scholarship students—it happens, but not often. And people talk."

"I would never use him."

"I know that. And Cameron knows that. But other people won't be so generous." She paused. "Tyler's already making comments. About how you're distracting Cameron from crew, how you don't belong in his world. If you two actually started dating, those comments would get worse."

My chest felt tight. "So you're saying I should stay away from him."

"No." Vanessa surprised me with the firmness of her answer. "I'm saying you should know what you're walking into. That it won't be easy. That people will make assumptions and judgments. That Cameron might lose friends over it."

"Which is exactly why this can't happen."

"Maybe." Vanessa tilted her head, studying me. "But I've also never seen Cameron this engaged with someone. This genuinely interested in another person's thoughts and feelings and life. That's rare, Sophie. That's worth something."

"Not if it ruins his life."

"It won't ruin his life. It might complicate it. It might challenge him to choose what he actually wants over what everyone expects him to want. But that's not the same as ruining it." Vanessa stood, smoothing her perfect sweater. "Look, I know you're scared. This is scary. But Cameron deserves to be happy. You deserve to be happy. And if that happiness is with each other, the rest of us will just have to deal with it."

"Why are you doing this?" I asked. "Why are you basically giving me permission to date your ex-boyfriend?"

"Because Cameron is my friend. And I want him to be happy more than I want him to be appropriate." Vanessa gave me one last smile. "Whatever you decide to do, just know that his feelings are real. You're not imagining it. And he's not going to stop caring about you just because it's complicated."

She walked away, leaving me sitting at my study carrel in complete shock.

Cameron had feelings for me. Real feelings. Vanessa had seen it, confirmed it, made it impossible to dismiss as my imagination.

I pulled out my phone, staring at the blank screen. Cameron had texted earlier asking if I wanted to meet at The Point this evening. I'd been planning to say yes.

Now I didn't know what to do.

Because if Vanessa was right—if Cameron actually had romantic feelings for me—everything changed. This wasn't just comfortable friendship anymore. This was something bigger, more complicated, more terrifying.

And I had no idea how to handle it.

For the next two days, I avoided Cameron.

I skipped our usual coffee meeting, sending a text that I had an early study group. I stayed away from the library, doing my homework in my room instead. When he texted asking if I was okay, I sent back brief responses: *Fine, just busy with exams.*

Rachel watched me with knowing eyes but didn't push.

I needed time to process what Vanessa had said. To figure out what I felt. To decide if I was brave enough to acknowledge what had been building between Cameron and me for weeks.

Because admitting it made it real. And real meant vulnerable. Real meant the possibility of getting hurt. Real meant crossing a line we couldn't uncross.

On Saturday afternoon, Cameron cornered me outside the dining hall.

"Are you avoiding me?"

"No. I've just been busy—"

"Sophie." His voice was gentle but insistent. "Did something happen? Did I do something wrong?"

Yes, I wanted to say. You had to go and make me fall for you. You had to be kind and genuine and make me feel seen in ways no one ever has. You had to look at me like I matter and listen like my thoughts are important and make me believe that maybe I could belong somewhere after all.

"No," I said instead. "You didn't do anything wrong."

"Then why won't you talk to me?"

Because Vanessa told me you have feelings for me and I don't know what to do with that information. Because acknowledging what's happening between us terrifies me. Because I'm not sure I'm brave enough for this.

"I just needed some space," I said. "To think."

"About what?"

About you. About us. About whether I'm imagining this thing between us or if it's as real as it feels.

"Just school stuff. It's fine."

Cameron looked at me for a long moment, and I could see he didn't believe me. But he didn't push.

"Okay," he said quietly. "But Sophie? Whatever you're thinking about, whatever's going on—I'm here. When you're ready to talk, I'm here."

The sincerity in his voice nearly broke me.

"I know," I whispered. "Thank you."

He left, and I stood there watching him walk away, my heart pounding with everything I couldn't say.

Vanessa was right. Cameron's feelings were real.

And mine were too.

The question was whether I was brave enough to do anything about it.
