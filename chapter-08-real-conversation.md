# Chapter 8: Real Conversation

I found The Point by accident on a Wednesday evening in late October.

I'd needed to get away from campus—from the constant awareness that I didn't quite fit. So I'd followed a path into the woods that ringed the lake.

The path ended at a rocky outcropping that extended into the water. A weathered wooden bench sat there, paint long since faded. The spot was far enough from campus that student sounds faded to nothing, replaced by gentle waves against rock.

I sat and watched the sun sink toward the tree line. The lake turned gold in the fading light. Somewhere across the water, a bird called—lonely and clear.

I'd called my mother on Sunday. She'd sounded tired—probably from working a double shift. When I asked how she was, she'd changed the subject, asking about my classes.

I hadn't told her about feeling out of place. She was working three jobs so I could be here. The least I could do was pretend it was worth it.

But sitting here alone as the sun set, I wasn't sure it was.

"I thought I was the only one who knew about this place."

I jerked around to find Cameron standing on the path behind me. He wore his crew sweatshirt and jeans, hands in his pockets, looking as surprised to see me as I was to see him.

"Sorry," he added quickly. "I didn't mean to intrude. I can go—"

"No, it's fine." I turned back to the water. "It's not like I have a claim on it."

"Still." He hesitated, then moved forward slowly, like I might spook. "Mind if I sit?"

I shrugged, and he settled onto the other end of the bench, leaving a careful distance between us.

For a few minutes, we sat in silence. The sun continued its descent, painting the sky in shades of orange and pink that seemed too beautiful for how I was feeling.

"I come here when I need to think," Cameron finally said. "Away from everyone watching."

"Everyone watches you?"

"Kind of comes with the territory. Legacy student, crew captain, applying to Princeton." He picked up a small stone from the ground and tossed it toward the water. It landed with a quiet splash. "Sometimes I just need to be somewhere no one has expectations."

I understood that more than he probably realized.

"How did you find this place?" I asked.

"My sister told me about it. She used to come here when she went to Lakewood." He smiled slightly. "She said it was the only place on campus where you could actually be alone with your thoughts."

"Smart sister."

"Yeah." He glanced at me. "What brings you out here?"

I should have deflected. Should have said something light and noncommittal and kept the carefully constructed wall between us. But something about the setting—the privacy, the fading light, the fact that Cameron had shared his own vulnerability—made me honest.

"Homesickness, I guess."

"Missing Milwaukee?"

"Missing..." I searched for the right words. "Feeling like I know where I belong. Missing my mom. Missing a world that makes sense."

Cameron was quiet, waiting.

"My mom works three jobs," I heard myself say. "Diner waitress during the day, grocery store stocker at night, weekend shifts at a hotel cleaning rooms. The scholarship doesn't cover everything. She's making up the difference."

"Sophie—"

"And I know I should be grateful. This is an incredible opportunity. Lakewood is supposed to be my ticket to somewhere better. College, career, all of that." My throat felt tight. "But I'm not sure it's worth it. Being here, I mean. Watching her work herself into the ground so I can attend a school where I'll always be the scholarship kid. Where people like Tyler see me as Cameron Reid's charity project and nothing more."

The words came faster now, spilling out before I could stop them.

"I'm always playing catch-up. Everyone else knows the rules because they've been in this world forever. They know which fork to use at formal dinners and what clothes are acceptable and how to talk about sailing and summer houses like it's normal. I'm constantly translating, trying to figure out what everyone already understands."

I finally looked at Cameron, expecting pity or platitudes. Instead, he was just listening, his face serious and focused.

"And the worst part?" I laughed, but it came out bitter. "I'm not even sure I should complain about it. People would kill for this scholarship. My mom is sacrificing everything to keep me here. I should be grateful, right? I should be working harder, complaining less, proving I deserve it."

"Should you?" Cameron asked quietly.

"Shouldn't I?"

"I don't know. It sounds exhausting." He shifted on the bench, angling toward me. "You're allowed to find it hard, Sophie. Having an opportunity doesn't mean you can't acknowledge that it's difficult."

"Everyone else makes it look easy."

"Do they?" Cameron picked up another stone, turning it over in his hands. "I bet if you asked, half the scholarship students feel exactly like you do. And plenty of the legacy students are miserable too, just in different ways."

"That's supposed to make me feel better?"

"No. I'm just saying you're not alone in finding Lakewood hard. You're just honest about it." He met my eyes. "Most people pretend. You don't. That's not a weakness."

Something in my chest loosened slightly.

"Have you thought about talking to someone?" Cameron asked. "Dr. Hartley, maybe? She went through this same thing."

"And tell her what? That I'm ungrateful? That I want to quit?"

"Do you want to quit?"

The question hung in the air between us. I thought about it—really thought about it for the first time.

"No," I admitted finally. "I don't want to quit. I just want it to feel less impossible."

"Then maybe that's worth saying. To Dr. Hartley, or to me, or to your mom." Cameron's voice was gentle. "You don't have to carry all of this alone."

I looked out at the lake, now deepening to purple as the sun sank below the trees. When I spoke again, my voice was barely above a whisper.

"Sometimes I wonder if I made a mistake. Coming here. My mom was so proud when I got the scholarship. And Lakewood is supposed to be the best education I could get. But what if I would've been better off staying in Milwaukee? Going to public school, being around people I actually understand?"

Cameron didn't immediately disagree or reassure me, which I appreciated more than he probably knew.

"You might have been," he said finally. "Or you might have always wondered 'what if.' There's no perfect answer."

"That's not comforting."

"Yeah, I know." He gave me a small smile. "But it's true. And for what it's worth, I think you're exactly where you should be. Not because of the scholarship or the opportunities or any of that. But because you're smart and interesting and you make this place better by being here."

My throat felt suddenly tight, and I had to blink against the sting in my eyes.

"You don't have to say that."

"I'm not saying it because I have to. I'm saying it because it's true." Cameron's expression was earnest, no trace of his usual easy charm. "You belong here, Sophie. Not as someone's project or someone's charity case. Just as yourself. I wish you could see that."

A tear slipped down my cheek before I could stop it. I brushed it away quickly, embarrassed.

"Sorry. I didn't mean to—"

"Don't apologize." Cameron's voice was soft. "You're allowed to feel things."

We sat in silence as the darkness deepened around us. Stars began to appear overhead, pinpricks of light against the darkening sky. The temperature dropped, and I shivered slightly.

"Here." Cameron shrugged out of his sweatshirt and held it out.

"You'll be cold."

"I'm fine. Take it."

I pulled the sweatshirt on. It smelled like laundry detergent and something distinctly Cameron—clean and slightly woodsy. It was warm from his body heat, and several sizes too big, the sleeves hanging past my hands.

"Thank you," I said, and I meant for more than just the sweatshirt.

"Anytime." Cameron leaned back on the bench, looking up at the emerging stars. "This is a good spot for thinking. I can see why you came here."

"Your sister was right. It feels private."

"Yeah." He glanced at me. "For what it's worth, I won't tell anyone about it. This can be your spot too."

"Our spot," I corrected without thinking.

Cameron smiled. "Our spot."

We sat there as the last light faded, and for the first time since arriving at Lakewood, I felt something like peace. Not because my problems were solved, but because someone had listened without trying to fix me.

Cameron hadn't told me I was lucky. Hadn't said I should be more grateful. He'd just listened, validated, understood.

And somehow, that made all the difference.

Eventually, the cold became too much to ignore. We walked back toward campus slowly, neither of us in a hurry. The path through the woods was dark, but Cameron's phone provided enough light to see by.

When we reached the edge of campus, Cameron stopped. Buildings glowed with warm light in the distance, students visible through windows. The real world, waiting.

"You okay?" he asked.

"Yeah. I think so." I pulled his sweatshirt tighter around me. "Thanks for listening."

"Thanks for talking to me." He hesitated. "I mean it, Sophie. You're not alone here. Whatever you need—someone to talk to, help with something, or just company—I'm around."

"Even after the mentoring period officially ends?"

"Especially then." His voice was firm. "This stopped being about mentoring weeks ago."

We stood there at the edge of the woods, neither quite ready to return to our separate lives—him to Morrison Hall and his crew team friends, me to Whitman and Rachel's knowing looks.

"I should get back," I finally said. "Before Rachel sends out a search party."

"Right. Yeah." Cameron shifted his weight. "See you tomorrow? Coffee before first period?"

"Terrible coffee?"

"The worst."

I smiled despite myself. "Yeah. See you tomorrow."

I walked back to Whitman Hall alone, still wearing Cameron's sweatshirt, feeling the weight of what had just happened.

Something had shifted between us tonight. Moved beyond surface friendship into something deeper, more real. I'd shown Cameron parts of myself I barely admitted to myself—the doubt, the guilt, the fear of not being enough. And he hadn't run. Hadn't judged. Had just... been there.

Rachel was going to have a field day with this.

But for tonight, I didn't care.

For tonight, I felt a little less alone.
