# Chapter 20: Decision

I don't know what made me go to our old corner of the library that night. Maybe some part of me was tired of hiding in the sterile isolation of the third floor. Maybe I was testing myself, seeing if I could sit in a place filled with memories without falling apart. Or maybe, in some secret part of my heart I wouldn't admit to, I was hoping.

The library was nearly empty this late on a Friday night. Most students were at the pre-regatta rally by the lake, the one I'd deliberately avoided. From the second floor windows, I could hear distant cheers and music, the sound of school spirit I couldn't quite bring myself to participate in.

I settled into the chair Cameron had shown me that first week—the one with the best light, tucked into the corner with a view of the quad. My European history textbook lay open in front of me, but I wasn't really reading. Just sitting in the space we'd shared, remembering how simple things had seemed in September. How full of possibility.

"I was hoping I'd find you here."

My head snapped up. Cameron stood a few feet away, still in his jacket, hair windblown like he'd been outside. He looked nervous and exhausted and determined all at once.

"What are you doing here?" My voice came out sharper than I intended. "Shouldn't you be at the rally?"

"I was." He took a step closer, then stopped, uncertain. "I left early. I've been looking for you."

"Why?" The word felt like a challenge.

Cameron pulled out the chair across from me. "Because I need to say some things I should have said two weeks ago at The Point."

I wanted to tell him to leave, to protect myself from the hope already fluttering in my chest. But I couldn't. "I'm listening."

He leaned forward, hands clasped. "I'm sorry. Not just for hesitating when you asked me to go public. I'm sorry for being a coward about what matters."

I stayed silent.

"I've spent my entire life performing," Cameron said, his voice intense. "Being the perfect Reid son. The ideal legacy student. Living up to everyone's expectations. I've been so focused on being who everyone thinks I should be that I forgot to figure out who I actually am."

"Cameron—"

"Let me finish." His eyes met mine. "You were the first person who made me want to stop performing. Who made me want to be authentic instead of perfect. When I'm with you, I'm just Cameron. And that version of myself is better than the one I've been performing for everyone else."

My throat felt tight. "Then why did you hesitate? When I asked you to choose me publicly, why couldn't you say yes?"

"Because I was afraid," he said simply. "Afraid of judgment, of choosing something real over something easy. I told myself I was protecting you, but really I was protecting myself."

He ran a hand through his hair. "But this past week has been hell, Sophie. Going through the motions while feeling hollow inside. And I realized that living for everyone else's expectations is a waste of my life. That you matter more than my reputation or what my friends think or whether my parents approve."

The hope in my chest bloomed larger, dangerous. "What are you saying?"

"I'm saying I don't want to hide anymore." He reached across the table, stopping just short of taking my hand, asking permission with his eyes. "I'm saying that going public will invite gossip and judgment and make both our lives harder, but I'd rather face all of that with you than maintain a comfortable image without you."

I let him take my hand, his fingers warm around mine. "Cameron, what changed? You were so sure two weeks ago that going public would be too complicated."

"I realized I was going to lose you." His voice cracked slightly. "That I'd already lost you, actually. And that losing you because I was too afraid to choose you was the worst thing I could imagine. Worse than disappointing my parents, worse than Tyler's judgment, worse than any social consequence."

He squeezed my hand. "I've spent my whole life being afraid to disappoint people. Afraid to step out of line, to make waves, to be anything other than what's expected. But the only thing I'm actually afraid of now is living a life where I lost you because I was too much of a coward to fight for what we have."

Tears blurred my vision. "You hurt me. When you hesitated, when you couldn't say you'd choose me—it felt like you were saying I wasn't worth the risk."

"I know." His eyes were bright with unshed tears too. "And I'm so sorry. You are worth the risk, Sophie. You're worth every difficult conversation, every judgmental look, every complication. You're the only thing in my life that feels real and honest and actually mine."

"What about the regatta?" I asked. "Your team, Tyler, all the pressure?"

"The regatta is a race. It's important, but it's just a race. Tyler is my friend, but friendship means accepting who I really am. And I'm done living under pressure to be someone else's version of perfect."

I studied his face, looking for doubt. "Are you sure? Because if we do this, I need you to be sure. I can't go through another breakup when you realize the social cost is too high."

"I've never been more sure of anything," Cameron said, conviction in his voice. "I know what I'm risking. But losing you isn't an option I can live with."

"If we try again, it has to be different," I said, needing him to understand. "No more secrets. No more hiding. If we're together, we're together publicly, no matter how hard it gets. I won't be your secret anymore, Cameron."

"I don't want you to be my secret." He said it firmly, without hesitation. "I want everyone to know you're my girlfriend. I want to sit with you at dinner, walk across campus holding your hand, bring you to the regatta celebration. I want you to be part of my life in every way, publicly and proudly."

But I had to ask. "What about your friends? They think I'm using you."

"Then they don't know you, and they don't know me as well as they think." Cameron's jaw set stubbornly. "Tyler will come around or he won't."

"Your parents?"

"Will have to accept that this is my choice." He smiled slightly. "They'd be less thrilled about me being miserable trying to be someone I'm not."

I felt my own lips curve. "You've really thought about this."

"I've had two miserable weeks." Cameron moved to sit beside me, still holding my hand. "I'm done being afraid, Sophie. I'm ready to be brave."

"Being brave is scary," I said softly, thinking about how terrified I'd been to end things, to demand what I deserved instead of accepting whatever he was willing to give.

"I know." He raised our joined hands, pressed a kiss to my knuckles. "But you taught me something. You were brave enough to walk away when I couldn't give you what you needed. Brave enough to choose your dignity over accepting less than you deserved. Now I want to be brave enough to choose you, publicly and completely."

"What's the plan?" I asked.

"Tomorrow's the regatta," Cameron said. "Come watch. Be there when I race. And after—win or lose—I'm going to tell everyone. Tyler, the team, anyone watching. You're my girlfriend, and I'm not hiding it anymore."

My heart hammered. "That's very public."

"That's the point." His eyes were serious. "I need to do this publicly. For you, yes, but also for me. The regatta is the biggest day of fall semester. Everyone will be there. If I'm going to choose authenticity over performance, I want to do it where everyone can see."

"What if you lose? What if the distraction costs the team the race?"

"Then we'll deal with it together." Cameron cupped my face. "I've already lost the thing that matters most by being too afraid to fight for it. Losing a race doesn't scare me anymore. Losing you again—that terrifies me."

I leaned into his touch, letting myself believe this might actually work. "I'm scared too. Of the gossip, the judgment, all the things you predicted would happen if we went public."

"I know. And it will be hard." He was honest about that, at least. "But we'll face it together, in the open, with nothing to hide. That has to be better than what we were doing before."

"Okay," I whispered.

"Okay?" Hope lit up his face.

"Okay." I said it louder, more certain. "I'll come to the regatta. And after, we'll do this. Publicly. Together."

Cameron pulled me into a hug, and I wrapped my arms around him, breathing in the familiar scent of him, feeling the solidness of his presence. We stayed like that for a long moment, holding each other in our corner of the library while the distant sounds of the rally faded away.

"I missed you," he murmured into my hair.

"I missed you too." I pulled back enough to look at him. "But Cameron, if we're doing this, we're really doing it. No backing out when it gets hard. No second thoughts when people start talking."

"No backing out," he promised. "I'm all in, Sophie. From now on, I choose you. Publicly, proudly, and permanently."

I kissed him then, soft and careful, like sealing a promise. When we pulled apart, both of us were smiling through tears.

"Two days," I said. "The regatta is in two days."

"Two days until I stop being a coward and start being brave." Cameron laced his fingers through mine. "Two days until everyone knows what I should have told them from the beginning—that you're the best thing that's ever happened to me."

We sat in our corner of the library until the building started closing, talking about everything and nothing, making plans, stealing kisses, both of us knowing that in two days everything would change.

This time, though, it would change in the right direction. Toward honesty instead of secrecy. Toward authenticity instead of performance. Toward choosing love even when it was scary, because not choosing it was scarier.

Cameron walked me back to Whitman Hall through the cold November night, holding my hand the whole way, and I felt lighter than I had in weeks. The path ahead might be complicated, but at least we'd walk it together.

And at least this time, we'd both been brave enough to choose it.
