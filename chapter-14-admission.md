# Chapter 14: Admission

Cameron was waiting at The Point when I finally worked up the courage to meet him there on Sunday evening. Two days of avoiding him had solved exactly nothing. If anything, staying away had made everything worse—the longing, the confusion, the constant replay of Vanessa's words.

*Cameron has feelings for you. Real ones.*

He stood when he saw me approach, his expression a mixture of relief and hurt. "You came."

"You asked me to."

"I asked you to meet me yesterday too. And Friday." His voice was gentle but there was an edge underneath. "Sophie, what's going on?"

I sat on our bench, and he settled beside me, leaving more space between us than usual. The November evening was cold, the lake dark and choppy. Above us, clouds covered most of the stars.

"Did I do something wrong?" Cameron asked when I didn't immediately answer. "Because if I did, I need you to tell me. This—you avoiding me, the distance—it's driving me crazy."

"You didn't do anything wrong."

"Then what is this? What happened?" He turned to face me more fully. "Two days ago, we were fine. And then you just... disappeared. Stopped answering my texts, skipped our meetings, avoided the library. Did something happen?"

Yes, I wanted to say. Vanessa happened. She told me something I wasn't ready to hear, and now I can't unknow it.

"Vanessa talked to me," I admitted finally.

Cameron went very still. "About what?"

"About you. About..." I struggled to find words. "About how you look at me."

The silence that followed felt enormous. I could hear the waves below, the rustle of bare branches in the wind, my own heartbeat pounding in my ears.

"What did she say?" Cameron's voice was carefully neutral.

"That you—" I took a breath. "That you have feelings for me. That I'm not imagining it."

More silence. Then: "And what do you think?"

The question hung between us. This was the moment. I could deflect, laugh it off, pretend I didn't know what Vanessa meant. Go back to safe friendship and bury whatever else might be growing here.

Or I could be honest.

"I think I'm terrified," I whispered.

"Of me?"

"Of this. Whatever this is." I finally looked at him, and the vulnerability in his expression nearly broke me. "Cameron, I'm terrified of being wrong. Of losing you. Of ruining the best friendship I've had in years because I misread signals and wanted something that wasn't really there."

"You're not wrong." He said it quietly but firmly. "You're not misreading anything."

My breath caught.

"Vanessa's right. I do have feelings for you." Cameron ran a hand through his hair, a gesture I'd come to recognize as nervous. "I've been trying not to. Trying to convince myself it's just friendship, that I'm projecting, that I'm being ridiculous. But Sophie, I can't stop thinking about you. You're the first person I look for in the dining hall. The reason I actually enjoy going to the library. The best part of my day, every day."

I couldn't breathe. Couldn't move.

"I don't know exactly when it happened," Cameron continued. "Maybe that first real conversation at The Point. Maybe earlier, when you called me out on my bullshit Princeton essay. Maybe it's been building this whole time and I just didn't want to admit it." He laughed, self-deprecating. "But somewhere along the way, this stopped being about mentoring. Stopped being just friendship. You became the person I most want to talk to, to be around, to share things with."

"Cameron—"

"Let me finish. Please." He took a breath. "I know this is complicated. I know we're from different worlds. I know people are already talking and it would only get worse if we—" He stopped. "But I also know that I've never felt this way about anyone. Not Vanessa, not anyone. You make me feel like I can be myself. Like I don't have to perform or live up to expectations or be Cameron Reid, legacy student. I can just be... me. And you're okay with that. More than okay."

Tears were building behind my eyes. "You make me feel that way too."

"Yeah?"

"Yeah." My voice was shaky. "You make Lakewood feel less impossible. You see me as more than the scholarship girl. You listen like my thoughts matter. You make me laugh and challenge me and—" My throat felt tight. "You make me feel like maybe I could belong with you, even though it doesn't make sense on paper."

Cameron's expression shifted—hope, fear, something intense I couldn't quite name. "Sophie, what are you saying?"

This was it. The moment I either stepped forward or stepped back. Acknowledged what had been building between us for weeks or pretended it away for safety.

I thought about all the warnings. Rachel saying I'd get hurt. James telling me legacy students don't actually befriend scholarship students. Tyler's comments about charity cases. The looks from other students. The invisible lines everyone said we shouldn't cross.

And then I thought about Cameron listening to me talk about feeling out of place, validating my experience without trying to fix it. Cameron sharing his own fears and pressures, trusting me with his vulnerability. Cameron showing up, day after day, choosing me over the easier path of sticking with his own social circle.

Cameron making me feel seen in ways no one ever had.

"I'm saying I have feelings for you too," I whispered. "That you're not the only one who looks for the other person in the dining hall. That library study sessions with you are the highlight of my week. That I've been falling for you for weeks and I didn't want to admit it because it seemed impossible."

"It's not impossible."

"It's terrifying."

"Yeah." Cameron smiled slightly. "It really is."

We sat there in charged silence, both breathing hard like we'd just run a race. The admission hung between us—real, undeniable, changing everything.

"So what do we do now?" I asked.

"I don't know." Cameron's honesty was almost a relief. "This is complicated, Sophie. If we—if we try this, people are going to talk. Tyler's already giving me grief about spending time with you. It's only going to get worse if we're actually dating."

"I know."

"Your friends might judge too. Other scholarship students might think you're betraying them by being with a legacy student."

"I know that too."

"And we'd have to be careful. The school has rules about relationships, and with you being a junior and me being a senior, with the mentoring program..." He trailed off. "It could get complicated."

"So we should probably not do this," I said, even though saying it hurt.

"Probably not." Cameron was still looking at me intensely. "That would be the smart choice."

"The sensible choice."

"The safe choice."

"But?" I heard the question in his voice.

"But I don't want to make the safe choice." Cameron shifted closer, closing some of the distance between us. "I want to take the risk. I want to see where this goes. I want to be with you, even if it's complicated and people judge and we have to navigate around rules."

My heart was racing. "You're sure?"

"Are you?"

Was I? This could blow up in both our faces. Cameron could lose friends, face team conflicts, deal with disapproval from people like Tyler. I could face judgment from scholarship students who thought I was climbing socially, from legacy students who thought I was after his money. We could both end up hurt.

But sitting here with Cameron, seeing the way he looked at me, feeling the warmth of his presence and the weight of his honesty—I knew I didn't want to walk away.

"I'm sure," I said.

Cameron smiled—genuine, relieved, happy. "Yeah?"

"Yeah."

"So we're doing this? Officially?"

"If by 'this' you mean acknowledging that we have feelings for each other and want to see where it goes, then yes. We're doing this."

"We should probably be subtle about it. At least at first." Cameron's practical side was showing. "Figure out what this is before we deal with everyone else's opinions."

"Agreed."

"And we should talk about expectations. Communication. What we both want."

"Also agreed."

"But right now—" Cameron reached out slowly, giving me time to pull away if I wanted. When I didn't, he took my hand, lacing his fingers through mine. "Right now, I just want to sit here with you and process the fact that this is actually happening."

His hand was warm despite the cold evening. Our fingers fit together like they'd been designed that way. The simple contact sent warmth spreading through my chest.

"This is happening," I confirmed.

"You have feelings for me."

"You have feelings for me."

"We're going to try this. Despite the complications."

"Despite all the very good reasons why we shouldn't."

Cameron laughed, and the sound was light, happy. "We're probably making a huge mistake."

"Probably."

"But I don't care."

"Me neither."

We sat there as darkness fell completely, hands intertwined, finally acknowledging what had been building between us for weeks. The path forward wasn't clear. The complications were real. The risks were significant.

But for the first time since this whole thing started, I wasn't afraid.

Because Cameron Reid wasn't the golden boy I'd assumed when we met. He was someone real and uncertain and complicated. Someone who saw me—really saw me—and chose me anyway.

And I chose him too.

Whatever came next, we'd figure it out together.

"I should walk you back," Cameron said eventually, even though neither of us moved to stand.

"Probably."

"People will wonder where we are."

"Rachel's definitely going to have questions."

"Tyler too."

Still, we didn't move. Just sat there holding hands, neither quite ready to return to the real world where this thing between us would have to navigate social hierarchies and other people's expectations.

Finally, Cameron stood, pulling me up with him. But he didn't let go of my hand.

"Tomorrow morning?" he asked. "Coffee before first period?"

"Terrible coffee?"

"The worst." He smiled. "And then maybe we can talk about what this actually looks like. The us part."

"The us part." I tested the words, liking how they sounded. "Yeah. Tomorrow."

We walked back toward campus slowly. At the edge of the woods, where we'd usually part ways, Cameron stopped.

"Sophie?"

"Yeah?"

"Thank you for being brave enough to try this."

"You too."

He squeezed my hand once more, then let go as we approached the lit campus. Back to being careful. Back to being subtle.

But something fundamental had shifted.

Cameron Reid wasn't my mentor anymore. Wasn't just my friend.

He was mine.

And I was his.

And whatever came next, we'd face it together.
