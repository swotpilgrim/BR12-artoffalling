# Chapter 7: Showing Up

I didn't expect to see Cameron again, not really.

After Saturday night's party, after feeling the full weight of being his charity project, I figured our tentative friendship had run its course. He'd fulfilled his mentoring obligations. I'd learned the campus systems. We could both move on.

So when I looked up from my chemistry textbook Monday afternoon and found Cameron settling into the study carrel next to mine, I couldn't hide my surprise.

"Hey," he said, unpacking his own books like this was completely normal. "Mind if I work here? Third floor's packed."

"It's a free carrel."

He smiled at my tone—not quite welcoming, not quite hostile—and pulled out what looked like a college application essay. For a few minutes, we worked in silence. I tried to focus on balancing chemical equations, but I was hyperaware of his presence two feet away.

Finally, I couldn't stand it. "You don't have to keep doing this, you know."

Cameron looked up. "Doing what?"

"This. The mentoring thing. You've shown me around, explained the systems. I can navigate Lakewood on my own now."

"I know you can."

"So..." I gestured vaguely. "You're done. You can write about it in your Princeton essay and move on."

Something flickered across his face—hurt, maybe. "Is that what you think this is?"

"Isn't it?"

"I told you before. Yes, I signed up for the program for college applications. But I'm not still meeting with you because of that." He set down his pen, giving me his full attention. "I'm here because I enjoy talking to you. Is that really so hard to believe?"

"Kind of, yeah."

"Why?"

I thought about Saturday night—Tyler's patronizing tone, Vanessa's polite distance, the casual wealth I could never be part of. "Because we don't exactly run in the same circles."

"So?" Cameron leaned back in his chair. "I can't have friends outside my 'circle'?"

"Is that what we are? Friends?"

"I'd like to think so." He said it simply, without the easy charm he usually wore. "Unless you'd rather I leave you alone."

I should have said yes. Should have taken the out he was offering and gone back to my safe world of scholarship students and academic focus and not getting attached to people who lived in completely different universes.

Instead, I heard myself say, "The third floor's not that packed."

Cameron grinned. "Okay, you caught me. I like this spot. Better windows."

"Right. The windows."

"And the company's not terrible."

Despite myself, I almost smiled. "Not terrible. High praise."

"I'm very discerning about study partners."

We went back to work, but something had shifted. The tension from Saturday night didn't disappear completely, but it eased.

Over the next two weeks, Cameron kept showing up.

He'd appear at my library carrel when I was studying, claiming he needed a quiet place to work. He'd save me a seat at lunch, ignoring Tyler's increasingly pointed comments about how much time he spent with "the mentoring program." He'd find me between classes to ask how my chemistry lab went or whether I'd finished the history reading.

It became routine—the kind of comfortable pattern that felt natural, like we'd been friends for years instead of weeks. He'd quiz me on French vocabulary while we walked to the dining hall. I'd help him brainstorm topics for his debate team arguments. We'd complain about the impossible reading load for history and trade theories about which teachers curved their grades.

"You know people are talking, right?" Tyler said one day at lunch, loud enough for me to hear from where I sat at the Whitman table nearby. "About how much time you're spending with her."

Cameron's response was too quiet for me to catch, but Tyler laughed. "Whatever, man. Your call. Just seems like you're going above and beyond the mentoring requirements."

I tried not to let it bother me. Tried to focus on my classes and my own life and not read too much into Cameron's continued presence.

But Rachel noticed. Of course she did.

"He's still hanging around," she observed one evening, watching me check my hair in our tiny mirror before dinner.

"We're friends."

"Sophie." Rachel's tone was gentle but firm. "I know you want that to be true. But Cameron Reid doesn't make friends with scholarship students. Not real friends."

"Maybe he's different."

"Maybe." Rachel didn't sound convinced. "Just... be careful. I don't want to see you get hurt when this ends."

"I know what I'm doing."

But I wasn't sure that was true.

Because despite Rachel's warnings, despite my own better judgment, I found myself looking forward to seeing Cameron. Our conversations had become the best part of my day—the moments when Lakewood felt less intimidating and more like a place I could actually belong.

We talked about everything. The impossible workload for Patterson's English class. The upcoming chemistry exam that had everyone stressed. The pressure we both felt about college applications, though from very different angles.

"My dad expects Princeton," Cameron admitted one afternoon in the library. "Like, not hopes for it. Expects it. He's already talking about which eating clubs I should rush, which professors I should try to study with. Like it's a foregone conclusion."

"What if you don't get in?"

"Not an option." He said it flatly. "Reid men go to Princeton. It's tradition."

"That's a lot of pressure."

"Yeah." He rubbed his eyes tiredly. "Sometimes I think about applying somewhere else entirely. Just to see what happens. But I can't do that to him."

"It's your life."

"Is it?" He gave me a wry smile. "Half the time I'm not sure."

I thought about my own college applications—the hope of scholarships, the desperate need to make something of the opportunity Lakewood represented, my mother's sacrifices. Different pressure, but pressure nonetheless.

"We're both performing," I said quietly. "You as the perfect legacy son. Me as the grateful scholarship student. Maybe that's why this works."

Cameron looked at me, something intense in his expression. "Maybe. Or maybe we just actually get each other."

The air between us felt charged, and I quickly looked back at my textbook.

A week later, Cameron asked if I'd read his college essay draft.

"You want my opinion?" I couldn't hide my surprise.

"You're probably the most honest person I know. Everyone else just tells me what I want to hear." He handed me several printed pages. "Be brutal."

I read it carefully—a well-written piece about leadership and crew team, hitting all the right notes but somehow feeling hollow.

"Honestly?" I said when I finished.

"Please."

"It's good. Technically perfect. But it sounds like every other college essay ever written." I met his eyes. "You're more interesting than this."

"Interesting how?"

"I don't know. Real. The stuff you told me about pressure and expectations and not knowing if you're actually good or just connected. That's interesting. This..." I gestured at the essay. "This is you performing."

Cameron stared at me for a long moment. Then he laughed. "God, you really are honest."

"You asked for brutal."

"I did." He took the pages back. "You're right. I'll rewrite it."

"I didn't mean—"

"No, you're absolutely right." He smiled, and it was genuine. "Thanks, Sophie. Really."

That night, I caught myself watching the dining hall entrance, waiting for Cameron to arrive. When he did, meeting my eyes across the room and nodding hello, something warm bloomed in my chest.

Rachel elbowed me. "You're doing it again."

"Doing what?"

"Looking at him like he's your friend."

"He is my friend."

"For now." Rachel's expression was sympathetic. "Just remember—when the mentoring period officially ends in three weeks, when he's written his essay and submitted his applications, you need to be okay with him moving on."

I knew she was right. But I couldn't quite make myself believe it would happen.

The following Tuesday, Cameron and I both reached for the same reference book in the library stacks. Our hands touched—just for a second, just fingers brushing—but the contact sent a jolt through me.

We both pulled back quickly.

"Sorry," Cameron said, and his voice sounded slightly off.

"No, it's—you take it. I can find another copy."

"Are you sure?"

"Yeah. Definitely."

We stood there for an awkward moment, too close in the narrow space between shelves, neither quite meeting the other's eyes.

"I should—" I gestured vaguely toward my carrel.

"Right. Yeah. Me too. Different direction, but yeah."

I fled, my heart pounding in a way that had nothing to do with being startled.

That night, lying in bed, I replayed the moment. The warmth of his hand. The way he'd looked at me—surprised, maybe something more. The awkwardness that had never existed between us before.

Rachel was wrong, I told myself. Cameron wasn't going to disappear when the mentoring period ended. We had a real friendship. The kind that lasted.

But a small, honest voice in the back of my mind whispered the truth I didn't want to face: I wasn't just worried about losing a friend.

I was worried about losing whatever this was becoming—this thing I couldn't name but couldn't stop thinking about.

And that was so much more dangerous than anything Rachel had warned me about.
