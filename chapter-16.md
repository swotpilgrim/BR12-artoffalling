# Chapter 16: Overheard

"You're going," Rachel announced from her desk, swiveling around in her chair to fix me with a look that meant she wasn't taking no for an answer.

I didn't look up from my history textbook. "I'm not going."

"Sophie." She stood up and crossed the small distance between her desk and my bed in two steps. Our dorm room in Whitman Hall wasn't exactly spacious. "Hiding in here every Saturday night is going to make things worse if anyone has noticed you've been MIA."

"No one's noticed," I said, but even I didn't believe it.

Rachel sat on the edge of my bed, making the springs creak. "It's a party in the common room. Low-key. Just people hanging out. You need to show your face, act normal."

"I don't feel normal." The words came out quieter than I intended. For the past few weeks, Cameron and I had been careful—so careful. Meeting at The Point when we could slip away unnoticed, stealing moments in quiet corners of the library, keeping everything private. Secret. But the secrecy was starting to feel like shame, like we were doing something wrong instead of just... being together.

"Which is exactly why you need to come," Rachel said gently. "Look, I get it. But hiding makes it seem like there's something to hide."

She had a point, even if I hated admitting it. I closed my textbook with a sigh. "Fine. But I'm not staying long."

"Deal." Rachel grinned, already heading to her closet. "Wear the green sweater. It looks good on you."

Twenty minutes later, we walked into the third-floor common room to find it already crowded. Someone had moved the furniture around to create more space, and a CD player in the corner played the latest Backstreet Boys album. The radiators clanked and hissed, making the room almost too warm despite the November cold pressing against the windows. The air smelled like cheap cologne, girl's perfume, and the particular staleness of a dorm room that never quite got enough fresh air.

I scanned the room automatically, looking for—and finding—Cameron near the window with a group of guys from the crew team. He wore a dark blue sweater that made his eyes even more striking, his hair slightly disheveled in that way that looked effortless but probably wasn't. Tyler Brennan stood next to him, gesturing animatedly while telling some story that had the others laughing.

Cameron's eyes found mine across the room. For a second, everything else faded and it was just us, the same electric connection that had been building since September. I saw the way his expression softened, the almost-smile that was just for me. Then his expression shifted back to neutral, polite acknowledgment between mentor and mentee. Nothing more.

The distance hurt in a way I wasn't prepared for. We were in the same room but might as well have been on different planets.

"Punch?" Rachel asked, nodding toward the makeshift refreshment table.

"Sure." I followed her, grateful for something to do with my hands.

The next hour passed in a blur of awkward mingling. I talked to James Parker about his physics project, listened to another scholarship student complain about her calculus professor, made small talk with girls from my English class. The whole time, I was hyperaware of Cameron across the room—how he laughed at Tyler's jokes, how he leaned against the wall with casual confidence that came from belonging here completely.

He didn't look my way again.

"I need to find the bathroom," I told Rachel eventually, setting down my plastic cup of overly sweet punch.

"Down the hall," she said, distracted by her conversation with James.

I slipped out of the common room, grateful for the cooler air in the hallway. The bathroom was occupied, so I waited, leaning against the wall and letting myself breathe without maintaining the careful mask of normalcy.

That's when I heard Tyler's voice from around the corner, near the vending machines.

"I'm just saying, man, you've been distracted all season." Tyler's tone was concerned but edged with frustration. "Coach has noticed. We all have."

"I'm fine." Cameron's voice, quieter than Tyler's. "We won last weekend."

"Barely." Another voice I recognized—Mark, another rower. "And you've been spending all your time with that scholarship girl. What's her name? Sophie?"

My stomach dropped. I should walk away. I knew I should walk away. But my feet stayed planted to the worn carpet.

"Are you guys dating or something?" A girl's voice now—Brittany, from my chemistry class. I could picture her perfectly, tossing her blonde hair, probably standing too close to Tyler.

Tyler laughed, the sound sharp and dismissive. "Cameron wouldn't be that stupid."

The words hit like a physical blow.

"She's kind of pretty," another girl offered tentatively. "If you don't mind the whole poor thing."

"It's not about pretty." Brittany's voice dripped with disdain. "It's about her obviously angling for access to Cameron's world. I mean, she's a scholarship student. Of course she's trying to social climb."

"You think she's using the mentorship?" Mark asked.

"Totally," Brittany said. "You can see it. She's probably hoping to meet his family, get invited to his house over break, make connections with wealthy people."

"Maybe she wants a rich boyfriend," the other girl suggested with a mean giggle. "That would solve all her problems, right?"

"Cameron's too nice," Tyler said, and I heard genuine affection in his voice for his friend. "He doesn't realize she's taking advantage. He thinks he's helping her adjust to Lakewood, being a good mentor. But she sees dollar signs."

"That's harsh, man," Mark said, but he didn't sound particularly bothered.

"It's true," Tyler insisted. "These scholarship kids—they're here for opportunity. And Cameron Reid? He's the ultimate opportunity. Fourth-generation legacy, family money, connections at every major university. She'd be crazy not to try to get close to him."

"You should talk to him," Brittany said. "Before she gets too attached. Or worse, before he does something stupid like actually fall for her act."

"I've tried," Tyler said, sounding tired. "But you know Cam. Once he decides to help someone, he's all in. He feels responsible for her because of the whole mentor thing."

"Someone needs to tell that girl to back off," Brittany said coldly. "Scholarship students should stick with their own kind. It's less complicated that way."

The conversation shifted then, moving to something about next weekend's plans, but I couldn't hear it anymore over the rushing sound in my ears. My face burned with humiliation so intense I felt dizzy. My hands shook as I pressed them against the wall, trying to steady myself.

They thought I was using Cameron. That I was some opportunistic social climber trying to take advantage of his kindness and his money. That I didn't belong anywhere near him or his world. They thought our friendship—our relationship—was nothing but calculation on my part.

And Tyler, Cameron's best friend, the person whose opinion probably mattered most to him, believed it completely.

The bathroom door opened and someone came out, but I was already walking away, heading for the stairwell instead. I couldn't go back to the party. Couldn't face those people, couldn't look at Cameron knowing what his friends thought of me. Couldn't stand there and pretend everything was fine when the whole foundation of what we were building felt like it was crumbling.

I took the stairs down quickly, my vision blurring with tears I refused to let fall until I was outside. The November night hit me like a slap, cold and sharp, but I welcomed it. Better than the suffocating heat of that common room, the weight of all those watching eyes.

I walked back toward Whitman Hall on autopilot, my mind replaying Tyler's words over and over. *Cameron wouldn't be that stupid. She's taking advantage. Dollar signs. Stick with their own kind.*

The worst part was the tiny, treacherous voice in the back of my mind asking if they were right. Not about me using Cameron—I knew that wasn't true. But about the impossibility of this working. About the fundamental gulf between scholarship student and legacy heir. About whether maintaining this secret relationship was worth the humiliation of knowing how his friends saw me.

I let myself into Whitman Hall and climbed the stairs to my room, grateful that Rachel was still at the party. I needed to be alone. Needed to think without anyone watching, without having to explain or defend or pretend.

I sat on my bed in the dark, staring out at the campus lights below my window, and let myself acknowledge the truth I'd been avoiding: dating Cameron secretly meant existing in two worlds. In one, when we were alone, I was just Sophie. He was just Cameron. What we felt was simple and real and right.

But in the other world—the public one, the one that included his friends and my peers and the entire social structure of Lakewood Academy—I was the scholarship girl. The charity case. The opportunist trying to climb above her station.

And Cameron was too kind, too nice, too good to realize he was being used.

The thing that hurt most wasn't even the cruelty of their words. It was how casually they'd said them, like my motivations were obvious to everyone but Cameron. Like it was common knowledge that a scholarship student getting close to Cameron Reid could only be about money and connections and social climbing. They didn't know me at all, but they'd already written my entire story.

I thought about my mother, working double shifts so she could help cover the costs my scholarship didn't. Thought about how proud she'd been when I got into Lakewood, how she'd cried and told me this was my chance for a better future. Would she think I was using Cameron too? Or would she understand that sometimes you meet someone who sees you—really sees you—and that's worth more than any connection or opportunity?

My phone buzzed in my pocket—probably Rachel checking where I'd gone. I turned it off without looking. Tomorrow I'd have to face this. Tomorrow I'd have to decide if what Cameron and I had was worth existing in this impossible in-between space where his friends thought I was using him and mine probably thought I was selling out.

Tomorrow I'd have to decide if I could keep being someone's secret when being secret made me feel like something shameful.

Tonight, though, I just sat in the dark and let myself feel the full weight of not belonging anywhere at all.
