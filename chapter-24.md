# Chapter 24: Preparation

The lakeshore was already crowded when Rachel and I arrived. Students claimed spots along the water, some with blankets and thermoses of hot chocolate despite the cold. Faculty gathered near the viewing deck of the Reid Boathouse, distinguished-looking alumni who'd driven in for the race milled around with coffee cups and Lakewood scarves. Blue and gold banners snapped in the wind. The air buzzed with excitement and anticipation, that particular energy of a community gathering for a major event.

I felt sick with nerves.

"There's a decent spot," Rachel said, pointing toward an area with a clear view of the starting line. "Come on."

We made our way through the crowd, and I felt eyes follow us. Conversations paused mid-sentence. People turned to stare. The whispers started immediately.

"That's her."

"The scholarship girl Cameron Reid's dating."

"Can't believe she had the nerve to show up."

"Wonder if she knows the team's been a disaster all week because of her."

"This is so awkward. Poor Cameron."

"I heard his parents are furious."

Each whisper felt like a small cut. I kept my eyes forward, my chin up, even though I wanted to curl into myself and disappear. Rachel's presence beside me helped—her steady calm, the way she completely ignored the stares and whispers like they didn't exist. So did remembering why I was here: for Cameron. To support him. To be brave even when being brave hurt.

We found our spot and I scanned the lakeshore, looking for the crew team. The Reid Boathouse was about fifty yards away, its modern glass and steel a contrast to the historic campus buildings. Through the windows, I could see movement—the team preparing for the race.

I couldn't see Cameron clearly from this distance, but I knew he was in there. Getting ready. Dealing with his own nerves and the team tension I'd heard about all week.

James Parker appeared beside us, hands in his jacket pockets. "Didn't think you'd come," he said to me.

"Almost didn't," I admitted.

"But here you are." He studied me for a moment. "That takes guts. Half the school is going to be watching you instead of the race."

"I know."

"For what it's worth—" James hesitated. "I was harsh the other day. About you dating Cameron. It's your life. You should be with whoever makes you happy."

"Thank you," I said, surprised by the olive branch.

"Doesn't mean everyone's going to be cool with it," he warned. "But maybe some of us are starting to realize the social boundaries we accept aren't as fixed as we thought."

He walked away before I could respond, leaving me with Rachel who was grinning. "See? People are coming around."

"One person isn't everyone."

"It's a start."

More students arrived, the crowd growing denser. I spotted Vanessa Price near the boathouse with some other legacy students. She saw me and nodded—not quite a smile, but acknowledgment. Dr. Hartley stood with other faculty on the viewing deck, and when our eyes met, she gave me an encouraging thumbs up.

Then the boathouse doors opened and the crew team emerged, carrying their boat overhead. Eight rowers moving in synchronized steps, the long shell balanced perfectly above them like some elegant water bird. They were in their racing uniforms—Lakewood blue and gold, tight-fitting to reduce drag. Coach Anderson walked alongside giving last-minute instructions, his voice carrying across the water.

My eyes found Cameron immediately. He was at stroke seat—the rower who set the rhythm for the entire boat, the position of most responsibility and pressure. Even from a distance, I could see the tension in his shoulders, the serious expression on his face, the way he held himself like someone carrying weight beyond just the physical boat overhead.

The team carried the boat to the water's edge with ceremonial care, lowered it carefully onto the lake's surface, began their pre-race preparations with practiced efficiency. I watched Cameron go through the motions mechanically—adjusting his oar with precise movements, checking his foot stretchers, making sure everything was positioned exactly right, doing everything an elite rower should do before a race.

But something seemed off. His usual confidence looked forced, like a performance rather than genuine assurance. His movements lacked their normal fluidity, that easy athleticism I'd seen in him before. He looked like someone going through required motions while his mind was elsewhere.

"He looks stressed," Rachel observed quietly.

"The whole team does," I said. And it was true—there was a brittleness to their interactions, a careful distance that shouldn't exist in a crew that had trained together all season.

Tyler stood near the boat talking to another rower, his body language tense. Even from here, I could read the frustration in his gestures. The team that should have been unified and focused looked fractured.

And I knew—knew—that it was because of us. Because Cameron had chosen to go public with our relationship right before the biggest race of the season.

Guilt twisted in my stomach. Maybe I should have insisted we wait. Maybe showing up today was selfish, putting more pressure on Cameron when he needed to focus. Maybe the supportive thing would have been to stay away, to remove myself as a distraction.

But then I remembered Rachel's words: *Cameron chose you publicly. Now you need to do the same.*

I was here. For better or worse, I was here.

The crew team slid the boat into the water, climbed in one by one with practiced efficiency. Cameron settled into his seat, adjusted his oar grip, assumed the ready position. From my spot on the shore, I couldn't see his face clearly anymore, just his back and shoulders as he faced the course ahead.

I wondered if he'd looked for me in the crowd. Wondered if he'd seen me or if I was just one face among hundreds. Wondered if my presence helped or hurt.

Coach Anderson stood on the dock with a megaphone, calling out final instructions. The team rowed toward the starting line in steady, measured strokes, joining the other schools' boats at the designated positions.

The announcer's voice crackled over the loudspeaker system, introducing each team. When they called Lakewood Academy, the crowd around me erupted in cheers. School pride and tradition, the five-year winning streak on the line, Cameron Reid maintaining his family's legacy in the sport.

So much pressure. So many expectations.

And I'd added to them by being the person he'd chosen to go public with, by being the complication that had fractured his team's focus, by being here now while everyone watched and judged. The weight of responsibility pressed down on me—if they lost, it would be because Cameron had chosen me over team cohesion. Because we'd gone public at the worst possible time. Because I mattered more to him than winning.

The thought was both terrifying and humbling.

"Stop it," Rachel said quietly.

"Stop what?"

"Stop thinking this is your fault. I can see it all over your face." She bumped my shoulder. "Cameron made his choice. He chose you, knowing what it might cost. That was his decision to make, not yours to feel guilty about."

"The team—"

"Will row their best or they won't," Rachel interrupted. "But either way, Cameron needs to know you're here. That you showed up for him. That he's not facing this alone. You being here matters more than winning or losing. It means you meant what you said about being together publicly."

She was right. I knew she was right. Showing up was the whole point—demonstrating that I was as committed to our relationship as Cameron was, that I wouldn't hide when things got difficult, that I was willing to face judgment and scrutiny because he was worth it. But watching Cameron out on the water, seeing the visible tension in his team, feeling the weight of all the eyes on me—it was still hard not to feel like I'd made everything more complicated.

The boats lined up at the starting line. Eight rowers per boat, four schools competing. The crowd grew quiet in anticipation. I held my breath, watching Cameron's back, watching the oar poised above the water, watching everything he'd worked for all season come down to this one race.

The starter raised the flag. The entire lakeshore seemed to hold its breath.

I found myself whispering a prayer I didn't quite believe in: *Let them win. Please let them win. Let all this have been worth it.*

Because if they lost—if the drama surrounding us cost Cameron and his team this race—I didn't know how we'd come back from that. Didn't know if our relationship could survive being the reason Cameron failed to maintain his family's legacy, to keep Lakewood's winning streak alive, to deliver what everyone expected of him.

The flag hovered in the air, ready to drop.

And all I could do was watch and hope and be present, because showing up was all I had to offer. Showing up and being brave enough to stand here while everyone watched, to support Cameron publicly even when I was terrified, to choose our relationship even when choosing it was scary.

The flag dropped.

The boats exploded forward.

The race began.
