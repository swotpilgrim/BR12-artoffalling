# Chapter 30: Belonging

The first snow fell on Lakewood in early December.

I woke to a world transformed—white covering the quad, coating bare branches, muting all sounds under perfect quiet. From my window in Whitman Hall, the view looked like a postcard: brick buildings draped in snow, students leaving first footprints across pristine lawns, the lake frozen at the edges.

Three weeks had passed since the regatta. Three weeks of navigating our relationship in the open, of learning what it meant to be together publicly, of finding our place.

It hadn't been easy.

Some students still whispered when we walked by. Some scholarship students still kept their distance from me, seeing my relationship with Cameron as a betrayal of our shared experience. Some legacy students still looked at us with barely concealed disapproval, convinced I was using him or that he was making a mistake.

But others had come around. Rachel had become genuine friends with Cameron, the three of us studying together in the library, grabbing meals together, Rachel's initial skepticism giving way to real affection for the person who made me happy. Tyler and Cameron had fully repaired their friendship, Tyler even going out of his way to include me in crew team social events. James Parker had warmed up, acknowledging that maybe the social boundaries we'd all accepted weren't as fixed as we'd thought.

And Sophie and Cameron? We'd found our rhythm.

We studied together openly in our corner of the library, no more hiding or pretending it was just mentorship. We sat together at dinner at tables that were neither clearly scholarship nor clearly legacy, creating our own space between worlds. We walked across campus holding hands despite occasional stares, claiming our right to exist as a couple.

I'd made peace with being visible. With existing outside the neat categories Lakewood preferred. I wasn't just a scholarship student anymore, and I wasn't trying to become a legacy student. I was Sophie Bennett, junior, academic scholarship recipient, Cameron Reid's girlfriend—all of it at once, complicated and messy and real.

Cameron had discovered he liked being authentic more than being perfect. Dropped the performance of ideal legacy student and just... existed. He was still crew captain, still academically excellent, still a Reid. But he was Cameron first, not the role he was playing. And I could see the relief in him, the way dropping that weight of expectations had freed something essential.

The winter formal was the Friday before winter break. The entire school gathered in the decorated gymnasium—white lights strung everywhere, fake snow on the windows, a DJ playing music from speakers set up on the stage. Girls in dresses, boys in suits and ties, everyone dressed up and pretending to be sophisticated while still being teenagers.

Cameron found me near the entrance, looking incredible in a dark suit that made his eyes even more striking. I wore a simple blue dress Rachel had helped me pick out, nothing fancy but nice enough for the occasion.

"You look beautiful," he said, exactly like he had that first night we'd gone public at dinner.

"You look pretty good yourself," I replied, grinning.

We danced. In the middle of the gym, with the entire school able to see, we danced. Cameron's arms around me, my head on his shoulder, swaying to whatever song was playing. No more hiding, no more secret meetings, no more performing for anyone but ourselves.

I saw Dr. Hartley watching from her position chaperoning near the refreshment table. When our eyes met, she smiled—proud and satisfied, pleased with how far we'd both come since September. Pleased that we'd chosen bravery over comfort, authenticity over performance.

Across the gym, I saw Vanessa dancing with someone from her class. She caught my eye and nodded, a smile of genuine approval. Tyler was there with a date, looking relaxed and happy, no more tension about Cameron's choices. Rachel danced with James Parker, both of them laughing about something.

The world hadn't completely changed. The social hierarchies and class divisions still existed. But we'd carved out a space for ourselves within them, proven that the boundaries weren't as fixed as everyone believed.

"What are you thinking about?" Cameron murmured in my ear.

"That I belong here," I said, surprising myself with how true it felt. "Not because I learned to fit the mold or pretend to be someone I'm not. But because I found the courage to be myself."

Cameron pulled back enough to look at me. "You do belong here. You always did. It just took everyone else a while to catch up."

After the dance, we bundled up in coats and scarves and walked toward The Point despite the cold and the snow. Our bench was covered in white, the lake frozen solid, the whole world transformed into something magical and quiet.

Cameron brushed snow off the bench and we sat, close together for warmth, looking out at the frozen expanse of white.

"I submitted my Princeton application," Cameron said. "But I also applied to three other schools. Places I'm actually interested in, not just places my family expects."

"Yeah?" I smiled. "That's good. That's really good."

"I don't know if I'll get in. Don't know if I'll choose Princeton even if I do. But at least now I'm making my own choices instead of just following the prescribed path."

"Your legacy isn't about living up to your family name," I said. "It's about choosing your own path with integrity. Being yourself instead of who everyone expects you to be."

"When did you get so wise?" Cameron asked, bumping my shoulder with his.

"When I met this guy who made me want to be brave," I replied.

We sat there as snow continued to fall, coating everything in fresh white. The campus was quiet, most students still at the dance or already in their dorms packing for winter break. Just us and the frozen lake and the choice we'd both made to be here together.

"We found something rare," Cameron said quietly. "Most people don't get this. Don't find someone who sees them truly and chooses them anyway. Someone who makes them want to be better, more honest, more real."

"Yeah," I agreed. "We did."

He turned to face me, snow catching in his hair, his eyes serious and warm. "I love you, Sophie Bennett. Not because you're perfect or because you fit into my world easily or because dating you makes sense on paper. But because you're you. Because being with you makes me want to be the truest version of myself."

Tears pricked my eyes—happy tears this time. "I love you too. For all the same reasons."

Cameron kissed me there at The Point as snow fell around us, the frozen lake stretching out before us, the campus quiet and peaceful. It was cold and perfect and exactly right.

When we finally pulled apart, both of us were smiling through snow-dampened faces.

"We should head back before we freeze," Cameron said reluctantly.

"Probably," I agreed, not moving.

But eventually we did stand, brushing snow off our coats, starting the walk back toward campus. The path through the woods was slippery with fresh snow, so we walked carefully, holding onto each other for balance.

Hand in hand through the snow, we made our way back toward the warm lights of campus. Tomorrow we'd both leave for winter break—me back to Milwaukee to see my mother, Cameron to wherever his family spent the holidays. We'd be apart for a few weeks, navigating the first real separation since we'd gotten together.

But we'd survive it. We'd text, call on dorm pay phones, write actual letters maybe. And we'd come back in January, together, ready to face whatever spring semester brought.

Because we'd learned the art of falling. Learned that choosing vulnerability over safety, authenticity over performance, love over the easier path—that was worth every difficult moment. Worth every whisper and judgment and complication.

We'd learned that belonging wasn't about fitting into prescribed roles or meeting everyone's expectations. It was about finding people who saw you truly and chose you anyway. About being brave enough to be yourself and trusting that would be enough.

And we'd learned that the scariest falls—the ones where you lost all your carefully maintained balance, where you let yourself be completely vulnerable—those were the ones most worth taking.

Because on the other side was something rare and precious and real.

On the other side was love. True, messy, complicated, beautiful love. The kind that transformed you, challenged you to be braver and more honest than you'd ever thought possible.

The kind that made cold Wisconsin winters feel warm. That made impossible social divides feel conquerable. That made you believe in happy endings even when the path there was difficult.

I squeezed Cameron's hand as we emerged from the woods onto the quad, our footprints the first to mark the fresh snow.

"Hey Cameron?" I said.

"Yeah?"

"Thank you. For being brave enough to choose me. For helping me learn to be brave too."

He stopped walking, turned to face me in the middle of the snow-covered quad. "Thank you for demanding I be better. For not accepting less than you deserved. For teaching me that being real is better than being perfect."

We kissed again, soft and quick in the cold, then kept walking toward our separate dorms, still holding hands.

Tomorrow we'd part for winter break. Next semester would bring new challenges—his final months before graduation, college decisions, uncertainty about the future. But we'd face it all together, two people who'd learned that falling wasn't failure.

It was trust. Vulnerability. Choice. Love.

And sometimes, the art of falling was really just the art of being brave enough to let yourself be caught.

I looked back once before entering Whitman Hall. Cameron was still standing in the snow, watching me, making sure I got inside safely. When he saw me looking, he waved—just like he had from the boat after winning the regatta, a private gesture just for me.

I waved back, heart full.

Then I went inside where it was warm, where Rachel would be waiting to hear about the dance, where winter break preparations and packing awaited.

But even as I climbed the stairs to my room, I was already thinking about January. About coming back to Lakewood. About spring semester and whatever it would bring.

About Cameron, and the life we were building together. The one where we belonged—not to any social category or prescribed role, but to each other and to ourselves.

The one where we were brave enough to fall, and lucky enough to catch each other.

The one where we were finally, completely, authentically home.
