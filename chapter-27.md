# Chapter 27: After the Race

The Lakewood crew took several minutes to recover enough to row back. I watched them drift on the water, slumped over their oars, chests heaving, completely spent. Even from shore, the exhaustion was visible—eight athletes who'd left everything on that course.

Finally, slowly, they began the paddle back. Easy, recovery strokes, getting the boat to shore while their bodies tried to remember how to function.

The crowd along the lakeshore was still celebrating, the energy electric. Students hugging, faculty shaking hands, alumni wiping away tears. Five years. Five consecutive wins. The tradition maintained, Cameron Reid proving he was every bit the athlete his family name suggested.

I stood with Rachel at the edge of the crowd, watching the boat approach the dock. My heart was still racing, adrenaline from the race still coursing through my system even though I'd done nothing but watch.

"You should go down there," Rachel said, nodding toward the dock where people were gathering to greet the team.

"I don't know—"

"Sophie." She gave me a look. "He just won the biggest race of the season. Go congratulate him."

But I hesitated. The dock was crowded with important people—faculty, alumni, Cameron's teammates. His world, not mine. Pushing my way in felt wrong, like I'd be intruding on a moment that belonged to them.

And I was terrified. This was it—the moment Cameron had promised. After the race, he'd said, he would make our relationship fully public. Would acknowledge me in front of everyone. Would choose me openly, no matter the cost.

But would he really? Now that the adrenaline of the win was fading, now that the reality of what that meant was immediate and unavoidable—would he follow through?

The boat reached the dock. Hands reached out to steady it, help the exhausted rowers out. Coach Anderson was there, beaming, already congratulating them. Tyler stepped out first, shaky after the brutal effort, immediately engulfed in hugs.

Then Cameron stepped onto the dock.

Even exhausted, barely able to stand, he looked incredible. His racing uniform clung to him, damp with sweat and lake water. His hair disheveled, face flushed. He accepted congratulations from people crowding around—handshakes, back slaps, excited voices blending together.

Coach Anderson grabbed him in a bear hug, said something I couldn't hear that made Cameron smile. Tyler was there next, any tension from the past week apparently forgotten in the rush of victory. They clasped hands, pulled each other into a brief hug, the camaraderie of teammates who'd just accomplished something extraordinary together.

The celebration on the dock grew louder. More people pushing forward. Cameron's boat crew surrounding him, all of them exhausted and exhilarated. The perfect picture of championship athletics—a team celebrating victory, a captain who'd delivered under pressure, tradition maintained and legacy preserved.

And I stood back from it all, watching. Part of me wanted to join them, to be part of that celebration. But a bigger part was afraid—afraid I didn't belong in that world, afraid of pushing myself into a space that wasn't mine, afraid that Cameron would see me and regret his promise, would decide that keeping his relationship private was better after all.

Then Cameron looked up.

His eyes scanned the crowd systematically, purposefully. Not celebrating anymore, not accepting congratulations. Just searching. Looking for someone.

Looking for me.

Our eyes met across the fifty feet of crowded lakeshore between us, and the transformation in his expression made my breath catch. Relief and joy and something fierce and determined all mixed together. Like finding me in that crowd was more important than the race he'd just won, more important than the celebration happening around him, more important than anything.

He started moving toward me.

People were still trying to congratulate him, still reaching out to shake his hand or clap his shoulder. Important people—faculty, alumni, donors probably. People who mattered in his world. But Cameron barely acknowledged them. Just murmured thanks and kept moving, pushing through the crowd with single-minded purpose.

Toward me.

The crowd noticed. How could they not? Conversations faltered. People turned to see where Cameron Reid was going with such determination, still breathing hard from the race, still in his wet racing uniform, bypassing important people and moving through the celebrating crowd like they didn't exist.

And when they saw his trajectory—saw him heading straight for me, the scholarship girl standing at the edge of everything—the whispers started.

But Cameron didn't slow down. Didn't hesitate. Didn't look around to see who was watching or judge what they might think. Just kept walking until he was standing directly in front of me, close enough that I could see the exhaustion in his eyes, could hear his still-labored breathing.

The crowd had gone quiet. Not completely silent—there was still celebration happening elsewhere along the shore—but our immediate area had fallen into an expectant hush. Everyone watching. Everyone waiting to see what would happen.

"Congratulations," I said quietly, my voice barely steady. "That was incredible. You were incredible."

"I wouldn't have wanted to win without you here to see it," Cameron said, and even exhausted, even barely able to stand, his voice was certain. Absolute.

The moment hung between us. The entire school watching. Faculty, students, alumni, teammates—all of them aware that something significant was happening, that this wasn't just a crew captain being congratulated by a friend.

I saw the choice Cameron was making. Could see it in his eyes, in the way he held himself, in the absolute clarity of his expression. He knew everyone was watching. Knew what this would mean. Knew exactly what he was about to do.

And he didn't care.

Cameron closed the remaining distance between us, one hand coming up to cup my face gently despite the trembling exhaustion in his muscles. His thumb brushed across my cheekbone, and I saw his eyes asking permission, asking if this was okay, asking if I was ready.

I nodded, barely a movement, but it was enough.

Cameron kissed me.

Not a tentative kiss. Not a private moment stolen in secret. A real kiss, public and unmistakable and deliberate. His other hand found the small of my back, pulling me closer. I wrapped my arms around his neck, not caring that he was damp and exhausted, not caring about anything except this moment and this person and this choice we were both making.

The kiss was salt and lake water and effort. It was Cameron pouring everything into this public declaration the way he'd poured everything into that race. It was both of us choosing authenticity over performance, choosing each other over comfort, choosing love over the easier path.

When we pulled apart, Cameron rested his forehead against mine, both of us breathing hard for entirely different reasons than the race.

"I love you," he whispered, quiet enough that only I could hear. "I should have said it before. I should have said it weeks ago. But I'm saying it now—I love you, Sophie Bennett."

Tears spilled down my cheeks. "I love you too."

The crowd reacted. I heard it happening around us—gasps, whispers, some sounds of approval, some of shock or disapproval. But it all felt distant, unimportant. The only thing that mattered was Cameron's arms around me, his face inches from mine, the absolute certainty in his eyes that this was right.

"Cameron Reid!" Someone shouted from the dock—Coach Anderson, maybe. "Get back here! We need pictures!"

Cameron pulled back enough to look at me, a question in his eyes.

"Go," I said, smiling through tears. "They need their captain. I'll be right here."

"Come with me," he said, taking my hand. "Please. I want you in those pictures. I want everyone to know you're part of this."

My heart stuttered. "Cameron, those are team photos—"

"And you're part of my team now," he interrupted. "The most important part. Please, Sophie. Come with me."

He didn't wait for an answer, just laced his fingers through mine and started back toward the dock, pulling me gently along. The crowd parted for us, students and faculty stepping aside, all of them watching as Cameron Reid walked back to his celebrating team with the scholarship girl's hand clasped firmly in his.

Some people smiled—I saw Vanessa among them, nodding her approval. Dr. Hartley caught my eye and gave me a proud thumbs up. Rachel was grinning like a maniac. James Parker looked surprised but not hostile.

Others looked less pleased—whispers following in our wake, judgment evident in their expressions, disapproval at this breach of social boundaries.

But Cameron didn't let go of my hand. Didn't drop it or slow down or show any uncertainty. Just walked with me through that gauntlet of reactions back to where his team waited, back to the celebration, back to his world that I was now publicly, unmistakably part of.

Tyler was the first to react when we reached the dock. He looked at our joined hands, at Cameron's determined expression, at me standing there terrified and uncertain. For a long moment, I thought he might say something cutting, might challenge this public declaration.

Then he shook his head with a slight smile. "You really did it. You chose her over everything else."

"Yeah," Cameron said simply. "I did."

Tyler studied us both, then extended his hand to me. "Tyler Brennan. I don't think we've been properly introduced."

I shook his hand, surprised. "Sophie Bennett."

"I know," he said. "I've heard a lot about you. Most of it from people who don't actually know you." He paused. "I'm sorry for being one of those people. For what I said at the party, and for giving Cameron grief about this."

"It's okay—"

"It's not," Tyler interrupted. "But maybe it can be. If you're willing to put up with this idiot—" he gestured at Cameron "—then you must be pretty special."

Cameron grinned, exhaustion and joy mixing in his expression. "She is."

Coach Anderson appeared, camera in hand, already organizing the team for photos. "Reid! Stop making out with your girlfriend and get over here! We need the captain in the center!"

The casual acknowledgment—*your girlfriend*—made my heart sing.

Cameron pulled me along to the photo area, positioning me beside him as the team arranged themselves. I tried to step back, to remove myself from what should be a team photo, but Cameron's arm around my waist kept me firmly in place.

"You belong here," he murmured in my ear. "With me. Where everyone can see."

So I stood there, tucked against Cameron's side, while cameras flashed and the team celebrated and the entire school watched Cameron Reid publicly claim his relationship with the scholarship girl from Milwaukee.

It was terrifying and exhilarating and perfect.

And for the first time since arriving at Lakewood Academy, I felt like I might actually belong.
