# Chapter 21: Going Public

Cameron met me outside Whitman Hall at five forty-five, fifteen minutes before mandatory Saturday dinner. Rachel had watched me change clothes three times before telling me to just pick something and stop overthinking it.

"You look beautiful," Cameron said when I stepped outside, and the warmth in his eyes steadied my nerves.

"I look terrified," I corrected, but I took his offered hand anyway.

We walked across campus together, our joined hands visible to anyone looking. My heart hammered. A few students passed us, eyes widening when they noticed our clasped hands, immediately pulling out phones to text someone.

By the time we reached Carmichael Dining Hall, everyone would know.

The grand doors were just opening when we arrived, students streaming in for the weekly formal Saturday dinner. Cameron didn't let go of my hand as we entered the high-vaulted space with its long wooden tables and the smell of roast chicken wafting from the kitchen.

Conversation didn't exactly stop. But it changed. Dropped to whispers. Heads turned to track our progress across the polished floor.

I'd been eating in this dining hall for three months, always sitting at the same table in the scholarship student section. Cameron had his assigned seat with the crew team at one of the legacy tables near the tall windows. We'd existed in completely separate worlds, carefully orchestrated social segregation that everyone at Lakewood understood and accepted.

Until now.

Cameron led us to a table that was neither in the scholarship section nor the legacy area—somewhere in the middle, deliberately neutral territory. Or maybe it was deliberately defiant. Either way, every eye in the dining hall followed us.

We sat down across from each other. The seats around us stayed empty even as other tables filled up, students apparently unwilling to get caught in whatever drama was unfolding. I felt exposed, like I was on stage under harsh spotlights with hundreds of people watching.

"Breathe," Cameron said quietly, and I realized I was holding my breath.

I exhaled. Looked around. At the scholarship table, Rachel met my eyes and gave me a subtle thumbs up. James Parker looked confused but not unfriendly. At the crew team table, Tyler was staring at Cameron with an expression I couldn't quite read. Vanessa Price, Cameron's ex, watched us with what looked like surprised respect.

Dr. Hartley, sitting at the faculty table on the raised platform, caught my eye and smiled.

Then Cameron reached across the table and took my hand in clear view of everyone. The whispers grew louder.

"Let them talk," he murmured, his thumb tracing circles on my palm. "I'm done caring what they think."

Dinner arrived in stages, served family-style. Cameron served us both, talking about his history paper, asking about my calculus exam, maintaining normalcy. I tried to respond naturally, to eat despite the knots in my stomach.

But I was acutely aware of every whispered conversation. Every glance. Every student who walked past just to look.

"Is that really Cameron Reid?" someone whispered loud enough to hear.

"With the scholarship girl from Milwaukee?"

"I heard they've been secretly dating for weeks."

"Tyler's going to be pissed. The regatta's tomorrow."

"What is he thinking?"

I wanted to sink through the floor. Cameron's jaw tightened, but he didn't let go of my hand.

"Talk to me," he said. "Tell me about your mom. How's she doing?"

It was the right thing to ask—the thing that reminded me why this mattered, why we were doing this. I told him about my last phone call home, about my mother's double shift at the hospital, about her pride in my midterm grades. Cameron listened like no one else existed, like the entire dining hall wasn't watching us, like this was just a normal dinner conversation between two people who cared about each other.

Which, I realized, it was. That was the whole point.

Dinner lasted an eternity and no time at all. When the dessert plates were cleared and students started standing to leave, Cameron stood and offered me his hand. I took it, and we walked out of Carmichael Dining Hall together, still holding hands, while the entire school watched.

The November evening air was cold, but Cameron kept my hand warm. We walked across campus on the main path. Students were everywhere—heading to dorms, the library, hanging out on the quad—and all of them noticed us.

"There they are."

"The regatta's tomorrow. This is such bad timing."

"I can't believe Cameron Reid is actually dating her."

Cameron's grip tightened but he didn't react, didn't let go, didn't change pace. We just walked like any couple, like we had every right to be together.

We were almost to the library when Tyler appeared, stepping directly into our path with two other guys from the crew team.

"Cam." Tyler's voice was tight. "Can we talk?"

Cameron stopped but didn't let go of my hand. "Sure."

"Alone," Tyler added, glancing at me.

"No," Cameron said calmly. "Whatever you have to say, you can say in front of Sophie."

Tyler's jaw clenched. "Fine. What the hell are you doing? The regatta's tomorrow. The biggest race of the season. And you're creating drama right before we need to be focused?"

"I'm not creating drama," Cameron said evenly. "I'm dating someone I care about. That's not drama, Tyler. That's my life."

"You're dating a scholarship student," one of the other guys said, like it was the most absurd thing he'd ever heard. "The crew team captain and a charity case. Do you know what people are saying?"

"I don't care what people are saying." Cameron's voice had an edge now. "Sophie's my girlfriend. If anyone has a problem with that, they can deal with it."

Tyler stepped closer. "I'm your friend, man. I'm trying to help you. This is going to make things complicated—for you, for the team. You need to think about timing. After the regatta, fine, date whoever you want. But right now? We need you focused."

"Some things are more important than winning a race," Cameron said, and I heard the steel in his voice.

"The team needs you," Tyler insisted. "Your family's legacy, the five-year winning streak, Coach Anderson's career record—that all depends on tomorrow. And you're letting yourself get distracted by—"

"By the person who matters most to me," Cameron interrupted. "Yes. I am. Because I'd rather lose the race than lose her."

The two other crew guys exchanged glances. Tyler looked like Cameron had slapped him.

"You're serious," Tyler said slowly. "You're actually choosing her over the team."

"I'm not choosing one over the other," Cameron said. "I can care about Sophie and still row my best tomorrow. But if I have to choose between being with her and keeping the team happy, then yes, I choose her. Every time."

Tyler shook his head. "This is crazy. You're throwing away everything for—"

"For something real," Cameron cut him off. "For someone who sees me as Cameron, not Cameron Reid the legacy student. For a relationship that matters more than maintaining some perfect image." He squeezed my hand. "I know you don't understand. But you don't have to. You just have to accept it."

"And if the team can't focus tomorrow because of this distraction?" Tyler demanded. "If we lose because you decided to go public right before the biggest race of the season?"

"Then we lose," Cameron said simply. "And I'll accept responsibility for that. But I'm not going to hide who I am or who I care about to avoid potential consequences. I'm done living that way."

Tyler stared at him for a long moment, something shifting in his expression. "You're really willing to risk everything for her."

"Yes," Cameron said without hesitation. "I am."

The other crew guys looked uncomfortable now, like they'd expected Tyler to talk some sense into Cameron and didn't know what to do when that didn't work. Tyler himself just looked tired and frustrated and maybe, underneath it all, a little sad.

"Your choice, man," Tyler said finally. "But don't expect me to clean up the mess when this blows up in your face."

He walked away, the other guys following. Cameron and I stood there in the darkening evening, his hand still holding mine, both of us shaken by the confrontation but still standing together.

"That was intense," I said quietly.

"Yeah." Cameron exhaled slowly. "You okay?"

"I was going to ask you the same thing." I looked up at him. "Tyler's your best friend."

"Tyler's my friend," Cameron corrected. "But he doesn't get to decide how I live my life or who I care about. If he can't accept that, then maybe we're not as close as I thought."

We started walking again, not toward the library anymore but toward the woods, toward The Point. Neither of us discussed it; our feet just carried us there automatically.

When we reached the bench, Cameron pulled me down beside him and wrapped his arms around me. I leaned into his warmth, feeling the tension slowly drain from my shoulders.

"We just did that," I said into his jacket.

"We did," he agreed. "We walked into that dining hall together. Sat together. Held hands in front of everyone. And we survived."

"Everyone's going to be talking about it."

"Probably," Cameron said. "Let them talk. At least now they're talking about the truth instead of speculating."

I pulled back enough to see his face in the fading light. "Are you okay? Really?"

He considered the question. "I'm shaken. That confrontation with Tyler was harder than I expected. But I'm also relieved. The secret's out. We don't have to hide anymore. Everyone knows now."

"Everyone knows," I repeated, testing the words. The weight of them. The freedom of them.

Cameron cupped my face, his eyes serious. "I meant what I said to Tyler. I choose you, Sophie. Publicly. Proudly. Whatever consequences come from that, we'll handle them together."

I kissed him then, soft and grateful and certain. When we pulled apart, the stars were starting to appear over the lake, bright points in the darkening sky.

Tomorrow was the regatta. Tomorrow Cameron would race in front of the entire school while everyone watched to see if the drama would affect his performance. Tomorrow we'd face more questions, more gossip, more judgment.

But tonight, sitting on our bench at The Point with his arms around me and nothing left to hide, I felt lighter than I had in weeks.

We'd chosen honesty over secrecy. Chosen each other despite the cost. And while the path ahead might be difficult, at least we'd walk it together, in the open, with nothing to hide and everything to fight for.
