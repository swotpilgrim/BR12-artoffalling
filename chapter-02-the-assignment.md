# Chapter 2: The Assignment

Dr. Hartley's office was tucked into a corner of the English building, a cozy space filled with overstuffed bookshelves and the smell of old paper. When I knocked on the doorframe the next morning, she looked up from her desk and smiled warmly.

"Sophie Bennett. Come in, please."

I took the chair across from her desk, trying not to fidget. Dr. Hartley was in her forties, with graying hair pulled back in a clip and reading glasses hanging from a beaded chain around her neck. She had kind eyes and the sort of comfortable, worn cardigan that suggested she cared more about books than fashion.

"How was your first night?" She closed the folder she'd been reviewing—my file, I realized, seeing my name on the tab.

"Fine. Good." I tried to sound confident. "My roommate is nice."

"Rachel Morrison. She's a good student." Dr. Hartley leaned back in her chair, studying me with the same assessing look Rachel had given me yesterday. "I imagine she's already given you the unofficial tour of Lakewood's social landscape."

Despite myself, I smiled. "She was pretty direct about it."

"Rachel's pragmatic. It serves her well." Dr. Hartley picked up a pen, tapping it against her desk blotter. "I advocated for your scholarship application, Sophie. I want you to know that. Your academic record was exceptional, and your essay showed real intellectual curiosity."

"Thank you." The words felt inadequate.

"I also know that being here won't always be easy." She said it matter-of-factly, not unkindly. "Lakewood has its challenges, particularly for students who don't come from the traditional boarding school pipeline."

"I can handle it." I tried to sound more certain than I felt.

"I believe you can." Dr. Hartley pulled a different folder from her stack. "Which is why I've assigned you to the peer mentoring program. It's designed to help new students navigate Lakewood's systems—academic expectations, campus resources, unwritten protocols. Your mentor will meet with you regularly for the first few weeks."

"A mentor." I tried to keep the skepticism out of my voice. "Is that required?"

"Not required, but strongly recommended for first-year students." She opened the folder, scanning whatever information was inside. "Your mentor will contact you through the campus mail system with details about your first meeting. Check your mailbox this afternoon."

I nodded, already wondering who they'd assign me. Probably another scholarship student—someone who understood what it was like to be on the outside looking in. That would be helpful, actually. Someone who could give me advice without making me feel like a charity case.

"In the meantime, how are your classes? Any concerns about the workload?"

We spent the next twenty minutes discussing my schedule—English, history, chemistry, algebra, French. Dr. Hartley offered advice about which teachers expected what, how to manage the reading load, where to find extra help if I needed it. She'd attended boarding school on scholarship herself, she mentioned casually, and understood both the opportunities and the challenges.

When I finally left her office, I felt steadier. At least one adult here seemed to actually see me as something other than a diversity statistic.

The campus mailroom was in the student center basement, a cramped space lined with brass mailboxes that looked like they'd been installed sometime in the 1950s. Each box had a combination lock and a name card. I found mine—314, matching my room number—and worked the combination they'd given me at check-in.

Inside was a single white envelope with my name written in neat, unfamiliar handwriting.

I took it back to my room before opening it. Rachel was at her desk, reading a thick history textbook and highlighting passages in yellow.

"What's that?" she asked without looking up.

"Mentor assignment." I slid my finger under the envelope flap, pulling out a folded note written on Lakewood stationery.

*Dear Sophie,*

*I've been assigned as your peer mentor for the fall semester. I'm looking forward to meeting you and helping you get oriented to Lakewood.*

*Let's meet tomorrow morning at 9:00 AM in the Reid Library lobby. I'll show you around the library and we can discuss your schedule and any questions you have.*

*See you then,*
*Cameron Reid*

I read it twice, then looked up at Rachel. "Do you know someone named Cameron Reid?"

Rachel's head snapped up, her highlighter pausing mid-stroke. "Cameron Reid? He's your mentor?"

"Yeah. Why?"

She set down her book, giving me her full attention. "Because Cameron Reid is basically Lakewood royalty. His family donated half the campus. The library you're meeting at? Named after his grandfather. There are like three Reid scholarships for students from Wisconsin."

I looked down at the note again, at the confident handwriting. "What year is he?"

"Senior. Crew team captain." Rachel ticked facts off on her fingers. "Legacy student—his dad went here, his grandfather, probably back to the founding. He's applying to Princeton, everyone knows it. Popular, good-looking, one of those guys who seems to know everyone."

My stomach sank. "So exactly the kind of person who's doing this to look good on college applications."

"Probably." Rachel's expression was sympathetic but realistic. "The mentoring program is voluntary. Legacy students sign up because admissions officers love that community service stuff."

I folded the note and set it on my desk, trying to ignore the disappointment settling in my chest. I'd hoped for someone who actually understood what it was like to be new here, to not fit in. Instead I got assigned to someone who probably saw me as a box to check on his Princeton application.

"Well, at least he'll know all the campus systems," I said, trying to sound practical like Rachel.

"He will. Cameron's not stupid, and I've never heard anyone say he's mean." Rachel went back to her textbook. "Just don't expect him to actually care. You're a responsibility to him, not a person."

"Right."

I pulled out the student directory they'd given all of us at orientation—a spiral-bound booklet with photos and basic information about every student. I flipped to the R section.

There he was: Cameron Reid, senior. The photo showed a guy with dark hair, athletic build, wearing a Lakewood crew sweatshirt. He had the kind of face that would probably be called classically handsome—strong jawline, straight nose, eyes that looked dark in the black-and-white photo. He was smiling, but it was the practiced smile of someone who'd posed for a thousand photos like this.

Next to his name: Crew Team Captain, Debate Team, National Honor Society. Hometown: Lake Forest, Illinois. Projected college: Princeton.

Of course. Princeton.

I closed the directory and tried not to think about the fact that I was now this person's assigned charity project.

That afternoon, I went to the Reid Library to do homework. If I was going to meet my mentor there tomorrow, I figured I should at least know where it was.

The building was impossible to miss—three stories of red brick and white columns, with "Reid Library" carved into the stone lintel above the entrance. Inside, it smelled like old books and furniture polish. The main floor had long tables where students sat studying, their expensive backpacks piled on chairs beside them.

I found an empty carrel on the second floor, tucked into a corner where I could see the lake through tall windows. Pulled out my chemistry textbook and tried to focus on balancing equations.

But my mind kept wandering to that note, to tomorrow's meeting with Cameron Reid.

I imagined him being politely condescending, treating me like a project he had to complete. Showing me around with professional courtesy while checking his watch, making sure I knew he was busy and important but making time for the scholarship girl anyway. Maybe he'd introduce me to his friends the same way—"This is Sophie, my mentoring assignment"—like I was a pet he was taking care of.

The thought made my face hot.

Around me, other students moved through the library with easy confidence. They knew which study rooms to reserve, which floors were quieter, where the best seats were. They belonged here in a way I absolutely did not.

Through the window, I could see the lake stretching out toward the horizon, deep blue under the September sky. Sailboats dotted the water—probably students from the sailing team Rachel had mentioned. Everything here was so perfect, so polished.

I wondered what my mother would say if she knew I was already feeling like this—uncertain, out of place, resentful of the very opportunities she was sacrificing so much to give me. She'd probably tell me to buck up, work hard, prove I belonged. She'd remind me that I'd earned this scholarship through my own merit, not charity.

But sitting here in a library named after my mentor's grandfather, looking at students who moved through this world like they owned it, it was hard to remember that merit and belonging were the same thing.

I forced my attention back to chemistry, copying notes about atomic structures and trying not to think about tomorrow morning.

Cameron Reid would be polite, professional, and completely detached. He'd fulfill his mentoring obligations because it would look good on his Princeton application. And I'd smile and say thank you and pretend I didn't know I was just another line on his resume.

Rachel was right. I needed to focus on my own goals—good grades, college admission, getting out. Everything else was just noise.

But as I packed up my books and headed back to Whitman Hall through the golden afternoon light, I couldn't quite shake the hollow feeling in my chest. I'd been at Lakewood for two days, and I already knew exactly where I stood.

Tomorrow I'd meet Cameron Reid and confirm what I already suspected: that in his world, I would always be the scholarship girl who needed help, never someone who actually mattered.

I told myself it didn't hurt.

I almost believed it.
