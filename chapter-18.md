# Chapter 18: Aftermath

The library became my refuge. Not our corner—I couldn't bring myself to go there anymore—but a study carrel on the third floor tucked between the history and political science sections where almost nobody ever went. It had a small window that overlooked the quad and a desk lamp that flickered occasionally, but it was quiet and isolated and I could lose myself in textbooks for hours without seeing anyone I knew.

I threw myself into academics with an intensity that surprised even me. My European history paper that wasn't due for two weeks? Finished in three days. Calculus problem sets? Completed the day they were assigned. I spent my free periods in the library, my evenings in the library, even some of my lunch hours hiding in a library carrel with a sandwich from the dining hall, avoiding the social minefield of assigned seating and curious eyes.

Rachel found me there on the third day after my confrontation with Cameron.

"You know you can't actually live here, right?" She set a coffee down on my desk—the good kind from the café in town, not the dining hall swill. "The librarians will eventually notice."

I looked up from my chemistry notes, blinking against the headache forming behind my eyes. "I'm just studying."

"You're hiding." Rachel pulled over a chair and sat down, settling in like she had all the time in the world. "Which I totally get, but it's been three days and you've barely left this building."

"I have classes."

"Which you sprint to and from like you're being timed." She took a sip of her own coffee. "And you've been taking completely different routes across campus. The long way around everything."

Of course she'd noticed. Rachel noticed everything.

I set down my pen with a sigh. "I ended things with Cameron."

"I figured." Her voice was gentle but matter-of-fact. "Want to talk about it?"

I told her about the party, about overhearing Tyler and the others, about the confrontation at The Point. Rachel listened without interrupting, her expression shifting from sympathetic to something that looked almost like resignation.

"I'm sorry," she said when I finished. "That sucks. But I can't say I'm surprised."

The words stung even though I'd expected them. "You warned me."

"I did." Rachel didn't look smug about being right, just sad. "Legacy students don't cross social lines for scholarship students. Not publicly. Not when it might cost them something."

"Cameron's not like that," I said automatically, then stopped. Because he kind of was, wasn't he? When it came down to choosing between me and his reputation, he'd chosen reputation. Or at least, he hadn't been willing to choose me.

"Maybe he's not," Rachel said diplomatically. "But the pressure he's under—from his family, his friends, this whole place—it's real. And most people cave under that kind of pressure."

"I just thought..." I trailed off, not sure how to finish. That we were different? That what we had was strong enough to overcome class divides and social hierarchies? That he'd choose me?

"I know." Rachel reached over and squeezed my hand. "For what it's worth, I think you made the right call. You shouldn't have to be someone's secret."

Over the next few days, I settled into a new routine. I sat exclusively with scholarship students at dinner, rebuilding boundaries I'd let blur over the past few months. James Parker welcomed me back with a knowing look but didn't ask questions. The others were friendly enough, though I felt their curiosity about my time with Cameron like a physical weight.

I avoided everywhere Cameron might be. No more studying in our corner of the library. No more walks near The Point. I learned his class schedule through careful observation and planned my routes accordingly. Lakewood wasn't that big, but I became an expert at making it seem vast.

But I couldn't avoid thinking about him.

Late at night, lying in my narrow dorm bed while Rachel slept across the room, I wondered what Cameron was doing. Whether he regretted his hesitation. Whether he missed me the way I missed him—this constant ache that academic work could distract from but never fully erase.

I wondered if he was relieved. Maybe breaking up made his life simpler. No more sneaking around, no more complicated feelings for someone who didn't fit into his world. He could focus on crew and his classes and his Princeton application without the distraction of a relationship that was doomed from the start.

The thought made my chest hurt.

I heard about Cameron through the Lakewood rumor mill, which was both unavoidable and painful. He was distracted at crew practice. He'd snapped at Tyler during training. Coach Anderson had pulled him aside to talk. He wasn't eating much at meals.

Part of me felt guilty. The crew team's regatta was coming up—their biggest competition of the fall season—and I'd become a distraction exactly when Cameron needed to focus. Maybe Tyler had been right about that, at least.

But a bigger part of me was just angry. Angry that I had to feel guilty for asking to be treated like I mattered. Angry that wanting to exist publicly as his girlfriend somehow made me the problem. Angry that the whole situation was impossible and unfair and exactly what Rachel had warned me about.

On Thursday, Dr. Hartley called me into her office during free period.

"Sophie." She looked up from the essays she was grading and gestured to the chair across from her desk. "Come in. Close the door."

My stomach dropped. Had someone complained about me? Had my grades slipped without me noticing? But no—I'd been working harder than ever, turning in my best work all semester.

Dr. Hartley studied me for a long moment, her expression kind but concerned. "You look tired."

"I've been studying a lot." It wasn't a lie.

"I've noticed." She set down her red pen. "I've also noticed you no longer study in your usual spot in the library. And that you've stopped attending your regular mentorship meetings with Cameron Reid."

Heat crept up my neck. "The mentorship wasn't really working out."

"I see." Dr. Hartley leaned back in her chair. "Can I speak candidly with you, Sophie?"

I nodded, not trusting my voice.

"I've been at Lakewood for fifteen years," she said. "I've seen a lot of students struggle with the social dynamics here. The class divisions, the legacy versus scholarship tensions. It's not easy to navigate."

"No," I agreed quietly.

"I've also seen students try to bridge those divides. Sometimes successfully, sometimes not." Her eyes were kind. "It takes tremendous courage to try. To reach across those boundaries and connect with someone despite all the obstacles."

I wasn't sure where she was going with this.

"But it takes even more courage to be honest about what you need," Dr. Hartley continued. "To refuse to accept less than you deserve, even when accepting less would be easier."

My throat tightened with unexpected emotion.

"I don't know exactly what happened between you and Cameron," she said gently. "But I know that you've seemed different this week. More isolated. And I wanted to make sure you know that whatever choice you made, you're not alone here."

"Thank you," I managed.

"The most important relationships we have are the ones that challenge us to be brave," Dr. Hartley said. "Not just brave in reaching out, but brave in maintaining our boundaries. Brave in asking for what we need. Brave in walking away when something isn't right, even when it hurts."

I nodded, not trusting myself to speak.

"You're going to be okay, Sophie." She smiled. "I promise. This hurts now, but you're stronger than you think."

I left her office feeling simultaneously better and worse. Better because someone understood, at least partially. Worse because her kindness had cracked the careful walls I'd built around my feelings, and now the grief felt fresh again.

Friday afternoon, it happened. The moment I'd been both dreading and somehow anticipating.

I was cutting across the quad between classes, taking my usual circuitous route to avoid passing the boathouse. Cameron was coming from the opposite direction, probably heading to afternoon practice. We saw each other at the same moment, about twenty feet apart on the brick pathway.

For a second, neither of us moved. I saw the dark circles under his eyes, the way his shoulders seemed to carry extra weight. He looked tired and sad and beautiful, and I wanted to run to him and away from him in equal measure.

Then we both looked away. I veered left toward the library building. He continued straight toward the lake. We passed each other like strangers, like we'd never spent hours talking on that bench by the water, like he'd never kissed me under the stars, like we didn't mean anything to each other at all.

I didn't look back, but I felt the weight of the distance between us like something physical. Two people who'd been everything to each other a week ago, now nothing more than carefully averted eyes and too much space.

Back in my room that night, I sat on my bed and stared at the calculus homework I was supposed to be doing. The numbers blurred together, meaningless. All I could think about was Cameron's face in that moment on the quad. How he'd looked as miserable as I felt.

We were both suffering. Both paying the price for what we'd tried to build. But suffering together would have required him to choose me publicly, and he hadn't been willing to do that.

So now we suffered separately instead. Him with his crew team and his Princeton application and his friends who thought I was using him. Me with my scholarship student world and my academic focus and my carefully maintained isolation.

The distance between us felt insurmountable. The gulf we'd briefly bridged seemed wider now than it had before we'd ever tried.

And I still didn't know if I'd made the right choice, even though I knew I'd made the only choice I could live with.
