# Chapter 4: Campus Tour

Cameron was waiting outside Whitman Hall when I came down the next morning, leaning against the brick wall with his hands in his pockets. He straightened when he saw me.

"Morning. Ready for the grand tour?"

"As ready as I'll ever be."

We started across the central Quad. It was the kind of perfect September morning that belonged on a postcard—blue sky, leaves just starting to turn gold, students crossing the lawn between classes.

"The Quad's basically the center of everything," Cameron said. "All the academic buildings surround it."

Before I could respond, a group of guys called out from across the lawn.

"Reid! You coming to lift this afternoon?"

Cameron raised his hand. "Yeah, three-thirty."

The guys continued past, and Cameron turned back to me. "Sorry. That building is Hamilton Hall. English, history, languages. That's Mercer Hall next to it, sciences and math."

We continued walking, but we couldn't make it twenty feet without someone greeting Cameron. A girl with a field hockey stick over her shoulder waved enthusiastically. Two guys in debate team blazers stopped to ask about some meeting. A teacher loading books into his car called out a reminder about office hours.

Each time, Cameron responded with easy familiarity, and each time he introduced me: "This is Sophie Bennett, she's new this year. I'm showing her around."

The introductions were polite. People smiled at me, said welcome to Lakewood, asked basic questions about where I was from. But I could see it in their eyes—the quick assessment, the understanding that I was Cameron's mentoring project. They were nice because Cameron expected them to be nice, not because they actually cared who I was.

"You know everyone," I said when we finally had a moment of quiet.

Cameron shrugged. "It's a small school. Plus I've been here since freshman year. You start to recognize faces."

"Recognize? You know their names, their schedules, their inside jokes."

He glanced at me, something uncertain in his expression. "Is that weird?"

"No. Just..." I searched for the right word. "Different from what I'm used to."

We passed a bench where a group of girls sat studying. One of them—blonde, pretty, cashmere cardigan—looked up and smiled at Cameron.

"Hey, Cameron. Still planning on Tyler's thing Saturday?"

"Probably. You?"

"If I finish my history paper." She glanced at me. "New student?"

"Sophie Bennett. Sophie, this is Vanessa Price."

"Welcome to Lakewood." Vanessa's smile was warm but distant. Then she turned back to Cameron. "Tell Tyler I'll text him."

We continued walking.

"Vanessa's in my year," Cameron said. "We dated last year. Broke up over the summer, but we're still friends."

"Oh." I wasn't sure what to do with that information.

We reached Carmichael Dining Hall, the same building I'd eaten dinner in my first night. In the morning light, it looked even more impressive—massive windows, ivy climbing the walls, the kind of architecture that belonged in a movie about elite boarding schools.

"You've been here for dinner," Cameron said, "but let me explain how it actually works."

He led me inside. The hall was empty except for staff setting up for lunch.

"Assigned seating by house," Cameron said. "Your house is determined by your dorm. Whitman Hall sits there—" He pointed to a table near the wall. "Morrison house sits over there."

I noticed immediately. The Morrison table was central, near windows with the best lake view. Whitman was toward the back.

"Is that official?"

"The houses are official. Where each sits is tradition." Cameron walked between tables. "The older dorms have better locations."

"And those are the ones with more legacy students."

He looked at me, surprised. "You've done your homework."

"Rachel filled me in."

"Rachel's not wrong about the social dynamics. Lakewood has legacy families going back generations." He met my eyes. "I'm not going to pretend it's not there. The class stuff exists, even if we're supposed to act like we don't notice."

I appreciated the honesty, even if it stung.

We left the dining hall and headed toward the student center. Cameron showed me the computer lab—rows of desktops with sign-up sheets.

"Two hours per session during peak hours," Cameron said. "Come early morning or late evening if you need to type papers."

The student center basement had the mailboxes I'd already discovered, plus pay phones on the wall.

"Calling cards or collect calls," Cameron said. "Student discount at the bookstore."

He showed me bulletin boards where clubs posted meetings, the student government office, a small cafe. Every few minutes, someone greeted Cameron with that easy confidence I was starting to recognize as his default.

We ended up outside the Reid Boathouse, the modern building I'd seen from the library windows. It sat right on the lake, gleaming glass and steel that contrasted sharply with the campus's traditional brick architecture.

"This is crew headquarters," Cameron said, and I heard something different in his voice—pride, maybe, or possessiveness. "Boathouse, equipment storage, team meeting rooms. Named after my grandfather."

Of course it was.

"Do you want to see inside?"

"I don't want to keep you if you have practice or something."

"Practice isn't until this afternoon." But he checked his watch anyway—a habitual gesture, I was starting to realize. "Though I should probably let you get to class soon. We've been walking for almost an hour."

I'd been trying to figure out how to ask the question that had been nagging at me since yesterday. Cameron was turning to head back toward main campus when I finally worked up the courage.

"Can I ask you something?"

He stopped, turning back. "Sure."

"Why did you sign up for the mentoring program?"

For the first time since I'd met him, Cameron looked uncertain. "Why?"

"I mean, you're busy. Crew captain, college applications, all of this." I gestured vaguely at the campus around us. "You don't seem like you have a lot of free time."

Cameron was quiet for a moment, and I wondered if I'd overstepped. Then he ran a hand through his hair—the first gesture I'd seen that looked nervous rather than confident.

"Honest answer?"

"Please."

"It looks good for college applications." He said it simply, meeting my eyes. "I'm applying to Princeton. My dad went there, my grandfather went there. Legacy helps, but they want to see community service, mentorship, leadership beyond just sports and academics."

My stomach sank even though I'd already known this was the answer. Hearing him say it out loud was different than suspecting it.

"So I'm a box to check."

"I didn't say that."

"But that's what it is, right? You volunteer to mentor new students, you get to write about it in your essays, Princeton sees you're well-rounded or whatever." I tried to keep my voice neutral, but some bitterness leaked through. "I'm your community service project."

Cameron frowned. "It's not that simple."

"Isn't it?"

"Look, yes, I signed up for the program because it would look good on applications. I'm not going to lie about that." He crossed his arms, defensive now. "But that doesn't mean I'm not actually trying to help you. Both things can be true."

"Can they?"

"I think so." His jaw was set, clearly not used to being challenged. "I could be doing the bare minimum—one meeting, hand you a campus map, check the box and move on. But I'm not. I'm actually showing you around, explaining things, trying to make this easier for you."

He was right. I knew he was right. But knowing it didn't make it feel better.

"I appreciate it," I said finally. "I just wanted to know where I stood."

Cameron's expression softened slightly. "You stand as someone new to Lakewood who deserves help navigating a confusing place. That's it."

We walked back toward main campus in silence. The morning was getting warmer, more students filling the paths between classes. Cameron greeted a few more people, but the easy warmth from earlier had cooled.

When we reached the Quad, Cameron checked his watch again. "I should get to crew practice. Coach hates when we're late."

"Thanks for the tour."

"Yeah. Of course." He hesitated, then added, "Look, I know this is weird. The mentoring thing, the social dynamics here, all of it. But if you have questions or need help figuring something out, I meant what I said. You can ask me."

"Even though it's for your Princeton application?"

"Even though." A small smile. "I can be self-interested and helpful at the same time. Multitasking."

Despite myself, I almost smiled back.

Cameron headed toward the boathouse, and I watched him go—tall and confident, greeting two more people before he made it fifteen feet. He belonged here in every possible way. This was his world, his campus, his legacy. And I was just passing through, temporary and forgettable.

I turned and walked back toward Whitman Hall alone.

The campus looked different without Cameron explaining it. The buildings were just buildings, the paths just paths. Students passed without acknowledging me, wrapped up in their own conversations and inside jokes and shared histories.

This was what it would really be like, I realized. Cameron would fulfill his mentoring obligations for a few weeks, write about it in his Princeton essay, and move on. I'd be a footnote in his senior year—the scholarship girl he helped, the community service he completed, nothing more.

At least he'd been honest about it.

I climbed the stairs to my third-floor room, thinking about what Rachel had said: *Focus on your grades, get into a good college, get out. That's why we're here.*

She was right. Cameron Reid and his perfect preppy world weren't why I'd come to Lakewood. I was here for the education, the opportunities, the chance at something better.

Everything else was just noise.

I pushed open my door, ready to focus on what actually mattered.

Even if some small, stupid part of me had hoped, just for a moment, that maybe it could have been something more.
